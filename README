# Setting up the database

- Install postgres
- Create a database named 'sociallists'
- In python, do:

  >>> from sociallists import db
  >>> db.Base.metadata.create_all()

# TODO:

- On the add feed flow, do the following:
  1. Automatically refresh feed for the first time if no refresh has been done
- On the add feed flow add autodiscovery and redirect chasing before adding
  to the DB
- Use BeautifulSoup to extract thumbnails
- Extract enclosures and the like
- Re-visit use of requirements and packages and vendoring and the like
- Put river items in the DB so that we can efficiently re-run the processing
  steps for items that are out of the feed
- For the future, we'll probably need options on individual feeds for
  processing to make them better. It is possible to over-engineer this so be
  careful.
- Implement ATOM cache timeout and RSS skip hours and the like to poll more
  intelligently.
- Implement pubsubhubbub
- Fill out the More box in the UI to expand things
