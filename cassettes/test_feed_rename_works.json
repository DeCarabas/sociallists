safely share an old program, manual, game, etc. online. \u00a0<em><strong>Please note that safe != legal. \u00a0</strong>It is always illegal to share things you don&#8217;t own and you are responsible for any\u00a0repercussions\u00a0if you break your country&#8217;s laws. </em>\u00a0This post isn&#8217;t about whether it is legal. \u00a0This post is about whether or not you should be overly worried that you will be pursued by some IP holder&#8217;s legal department and sued into the ground.</p>\n<p>This would be\u00a0a good time to mention that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IANAL\">I am not a lawyer, and this is not legal advice</a>.</p>\n<p>Unless you are a large-scale pirating operation already under government investigation, what usually happens when infringement is discovered is that the infringing party is notified through a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cease_and_desist\">cease and desist letter</a>. \u00a0Quick compliance with the terms of the letter is almost always\u00a0enough to avoid further action. \u00a0But what if you are on a Quixote-like mission to share\u00a0this rare vintage\u00a0content with the world and really, REALLY want it to stay publicly available? \u00a0That&#8217;s when you apply The Phrase.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Beyond Economic Recovery&#8221; isn&#8217;t my phrase; it was uttered to me in more than one interview I&#8217;ve had with lawyers on this specific subject. \u00a0Here&#8217;s how to use it: \u00a0Let&#8217;s say you want to share a 30-year-old game on the web for others to grab. \u00a0If you&#8217;re worried about legal repercussions,\u00a0perform some due diligence and research if the company is actively using the work (the code, its trademarks, its intellectual property, etc.) to earn money, or has immediate or announced plans to do so. If so, such as in the case of Super Mario Brothers, <strong>don&#8217;t share it</strong>. But if not, as in the case of something like <a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game/space-strike\">Space Strike</a>, you have almost nothing to worry about. \u00a0When a company is made aware of\u00a0infringement (usually discovered via\u00a0automated google\u00a0searches and machine\u00a0learning), they perform a quick check of whether or not\u00a0they would lose money sending the infringing party a cease and desist letter. \u00a0The average cost of a C&amp;D letter, accounting for all time and services rendered, is roughly $4000. \u00a0If the company has\u00a0an internal legal department or prepares communication in batches (or both), that number can be a little less, but it&#8217;s still thousands of dollars. So the mental check is essentially &#8220;Can we make more than $4000 on the asset or intellectual property this person is threatening\u00a0to dilute by giving it away for free?&#8221; If the answer is &#8220;no&#8221;, they don&#8217;t bother sending a C&amp;D letter.</p>\n<p>The Internet Archive enjoys both non-profit status and various <a href=\"https://archive.org/about/dmca.php\">DMCA exemptions</a>, which allows them to make various historically-relevant software works available online &#8212; but a DMCA exemption doesn&#8217;t prevent companies from sending them C&amp;D letters to protect their trademarks or intellectual property. \u00a0(It also doesn&#8217;t succinctly define\u00a0what is covered under the exemption, as it uses words like &#8220;obsolete&#8221; without defining what time period &#8220;obsolete&#8221; refers to.) \u00a0Some works that used to be public on the IA have since been hidden at the request of the IP holder. \u00a0For everything else that is still public there,\u00a0The Phrase is the\u00a0principle that\u00a0&#8220;protects&#8221; those software portions of The Internet Archive; they are simply Beyond Economic Recovery.</p><br />Filed under: <a href='https://trixter.oldskool.org/category/gaming/'>Gaming</a>, <a href='https://trixter.oldskool.org/category/software-piracy/'>Software Piracy</a>, <a href='https://trixter.oldskool.org/category/vintage-computing/'>Vintage Computing</a>  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/trixter.wordpress.com/1384/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/trixter.wordpress.com/1384/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=trixter.oldskool.org&#038;blog=23286&#038;post=1384&#038;subd=trixter&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://trixter.oldskool.org/2016/01/11/beyond-economic-recovery/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>1</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/95363aee12ad9bff5db2c4425b22b313?s=96&#38;d=retro&#38;r=PG\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Trixter</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Jack of all trades, master of one</title>\n\t\t<link>https://trixter.oldskool.org/2015/12/31/jack-of-all-trades-master-of-one/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://trixter.oldskool.org/2015/12/31/jack-of-all-trades-master-of-one/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 31 Dec 2015 20:51:46 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Trixter]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Vintage Computing]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://trixter.oldskool.org/?p=1359</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a famous quote that, paraphrased, reads &#8220;I&#8217;d rather be an expert in one thing than dabble in many things.&#8221;

For anyone who knows me and my work who is\u00a0interested in <b>both </b>vintage IBM PCs <b><i>and</i></b> podcasts or YouTube channels/videos, it would help me out if you took a minute to give me your opinion via the survey.</p>\n<p>The survey link is: <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/RK6Q25S\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/RK6Q25S</a></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d rather just give me your thoughts in the comments below, that&#8217;s fine too, although it may help to glance at the survey text first to see what I&#8217;m going on about.</p><br />Filed under: <a href='https://trixter.oldskool.org/category/uncategorized/'>Uncategorized</a>  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/trixter.wordpress.com/1354/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/trixter.wordpress.com/1354/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=trixter.oldskool.org&#038;blog=23286&#038;post=1354&#038;subd=trixter&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://trixter.oldskool.org/2015/10/11/an-experiment-should-i-put-on-a-show/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/95363aee12ad9bff5db2c4425b22b313?s=96&#38;d=retro&#38;r=PG\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Trixter</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Solving an IBM PS/2 Model 25-286 Chicken and Egg CMOS problem</title>\n\t\t<link>https://trixter.oldskool.org/2015/09/04/solving-an-ibm-ps2-model-25-286-chicken-and-egg-cmos-problem/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://trixter.oldskool.org/2015/09/04/solving-an-ibm-ps2-model-25-286-chicken-and-egg-cmos-problem/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 04 Sep 2015 20:41:55 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Trixter]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Vintage Computing]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[computer nerd]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://trixter.oldskool.org/?p=1352</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[I solved something recently and thought others (read: vintage computer nerds) might be interested in the write-up.

I recently acquired an IBM PS/2 Model 25-286 and wanted to read data off of the hard drive. \u00a0The 25-286 relies on configuration data stored in CMOS, however the battery-backed CMOS is dead, leading to the error codes 161 and 163 on boot-up. The system miraculously boots from the hard drive just fine in this condition (documentation suggests the hard drive table is fixed to a single entry). But, you can&#8217;t transfer data off of a system in this condition because 1. The floppy drive table is wrong and thinks the 1.44MB drive is a DSDD drive and can&#8217;t read/write a 1.44MB diskette, and 2. There are no entries in the BIOS table for the built-in serial and parallel ports, so they don&#8217;t show up, can&#8217;t use MODE COM1, etc. Short of physically moving the hard drive into another system, there&#8217;s no way to get data in/out of it.</p>\n<p>The obvious fix is to write the 8525-286 diag and setup diskette somewhere and boot it to set proper CMOS values, but the diag/setup diskette image is a 1.44MB image, and the system can&#8217;t read it because the scrambled-CMOS configuration only reads/writes DSDD disks. So this is where the chicken-and-egg problem lies: <strong>To fix the system, you need to boot a diskette &#8212; but the diskette isn&#8217;t bootable until the system is fixed.</strong> (There&#8217;s another issue: Since the battery is dead, the setup disk will set proper values, perform a warm reboot &#8212; and then the values are gone again since the battery is dead.)</p>\n<p>Armed with the knowledge that that the system can read 720KB diskette media just fine if formatted in another computer, I was able to follow this procedure to temporarily force a functional system:</p>\n<ol class=\"decimal\">\n<li>Use tweener system to write out the 8525-286 diag/setup diskette from diskette image</li>\n<li>Copy resulting setup/diag files onto a 720KB DSDD diskette (NOT a 1.44MB diskette formatted as 720KB).</li>\n<li>Boot Model 25-286 from internal hard drive</li>\n<li>Run the &#8220;SC.EXE&#8221; program from the setup/diag disk</li>\n<li>Using SC.EXE, force correct values, then save them.</li>\n<li>Hit &lt;ESC&gt; to back out to DOS (do NOT hit enter to reboot the system)</li>\n<li>Perform an immediate, non-cold, non-warm reboot by issuing INT 19H (instructions below) &#8212; do not have bootable diskette in the drive, and for safety have an empty config.sys and autoexec.bat</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Doing this will leave the system in a correct state until you perform a warm (ctrl-alt-del) or cold (power) reboot. DOS will reload and parse the new temporary CMOS values. \u00a0The floppy drive reads/writes 1.44MB in this state, and the serial and parallel ports are recognizable and function. While I wrote this, I was archiving the entire hard drive to another system using FastLynx and a parallel-port cable.</p>\n<p>The proper fix, of course, is a Dallas 12887+ replacement battery/clock chip. Three are already on their way to me from China (hope they aren&#8217;t pulls!).</p>\n<p>To issue INT 19H, you can use DEBUG.COM. Start DEBUG, then type:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\">\r\n\r\na &lt;enter&gt;\r\nint 19 &lt;enter&gt;\r\n&lt;enter&gt;\r\ng &lt;enter&gt;\r\n\r\n</pre><br />Filed under: <a href='https://trixter.oldskool.org/category/vintage-computing/'>Vintage Computing</a>  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/trixter.wordpress.com/1352/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/trixter.wordpress.com/1352/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=trixter.oldskool.org&#038;blog=23286&#038;post=1352&#038;subd=trixter&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://trixter.oldskool.org/2015/09/04/solving-an-ibm-ps2-model-25-286-chicken-and-egg-cmos-problem/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>7</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/95363aee12ad9bff5db2c4425b22b313?s=96&#38;d=retro&#38;r=PG\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Trixter</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Converting a newer CGA card to an older one</title>\n\t\t<link>https://trixter.oldskool.org/2015/08/28/converting-a-newer-cga-card-to-an-older-one/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://trixter.oldskool.org/2015/08/28/converting-a-newer-cga-card-to-an-older-one/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2015 20:30:01 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Trixter]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Vintage Computing]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://trixter.oldskool.org/?p=1350</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[I don&#8217;t normally just reblog stuff, but Great Hierophant&#8217;s blog entry on how to convert a &#8220;new-style&#8221; CGA card to an &#8220;old-style&#8221; card is worth taking a look at.

even the <a href=\"http://rcrpodcast.com/\">Retro Computing Roundtable</a> hardly mentions it.</p>\n<p>What <em>has</em> changed in 2.5 years is my understanding of why that is. \u00a0I think the 808x-based era (8088 or 8086 computers that are IBM PC compatible, 1981-1989) is mostly overlooked because both the system and its users are <strong>stuck between worlds</strong>. \u00a0Let&#8217;s start with the IBM PC itself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Is it a home computer or a business computer?</strong> \u00a0It was a business computer for the home, so try classifying that one. \u00a0It definitely had business-class power and expandability (and price tag), but also had BASIC in ROM, cassette tape support, and could connect to home televisions.</li>\n<li><strong>Is it an 8-bit or 16-bit computer?</strong> \u00a0It came out squarely in the middle of the 8-bit era, and had an 8-bit bus and an 8-bit path to memory. \u00a0But, the 8088 is internally a 16-bit CPU, with 16-bit registers and a 16-bit ALU, \u00a0Most people categorize it as a 16-bit computer and part of the 16-bit era, but considering the Atari ST and Amiga are the poster children for the 16-bit era, it doesn&#8217;t feel like it should be in that category as it is significantly less capable than those systems.</li>\n<li><strong>When was the system considering viable for gaming?</strong>\u00a0 There were games available for the system in the same year it was launched, but many people consider games with <a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game/pc-booter/miner-2049er/screenshots/gameShotId,39378/\">ugly CGA graphics</a> or text-only adventures a party trick and not actual games. \u00a0I disagree, but ask most online people\u00a0what &#8220;DOS games&#8221; are and you&#8217;ll get a picture painted in\u00a0a VGA\u00a0palette.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The users/fans/retrohobbyists of the PC are also stuck between worlds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><del>Generation Y</del> <strong>Millennials</strong> grew up with the web, blogging, social media, YouTube&#8230; but the IBM PC was not their system, so they don&#8217;t cover it. \u00a0Most old PC gaming channels on YouTube, for example, consider &#8220;MS-DOS Gaming&#8221; as starting in the era of\u00a0386+VGA+soundcard systems. \u00a0These are good channels, don&#8217;t get me wrong (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/pushinguproses\">Pushing up Roses</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/phreakindee\">Lazy Game Reviews</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/Pixelmusement\">Ancient DOS games</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/dosnostalgic\">DOS Nostalgia</a> come to mind), but they only rarely cover the first decade of PC gaming. \u00a0That&#8217;s 10 years of games not getting coverage &#8212; quite a gap.</li>\n<li>So that leaves us <strong>Generation X&#8217;ers</strong> to cover it, because we did grow up with the PC&#8230; but, there are two forces working against early PCs getting coverage. \u00a0The first is that Gen X people also grew up with other systems. \u00a0The second is that not every Gen X&#8217;er is comfortable doing a podcast or video channel. \u00a0So out of the few that are, the attention is spread across all 1980s systems (including consoles), leaving a tragically small slice of people who are both capable and motivated to do so for the early PC.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Come on, I can&#8217;t be the only one. \u00a0Won&#8217;t someone start a\u00a01980s-era PC podcast or YouTube channel?</p>\n<p>(I thought the original classic Mac would have this problem too, but a cursory search of the interwebz shows a plethora of websites dedicated to classic macs, and even a <a href=\"http://retromaccast.ning.com/\">retro mac podcast</a> coming up on its <a href=\"http://retromaccast.libsyn.com/rmc-episode-376-68k-mla\">376th episode</a>. \u00a0Yikes!)</p><br />Filed under: <a href='https://trixter.oldskool.org/category/vintage-computing/'>Vintage Computing</a>  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/trixter.wordpress.com/1346/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/trixter.wordpress.com/1346/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=trixter.oldskool.org&#038;blog=23286&#038;post=1346&#038;subd=trixter&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://trixter.oldskool.org/2015/08/23/still-no-love-for-the-ibm-pc/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>19</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/95363aee12ad9bff5db2c4425b22b313?s=96&#38;d=retro&#38;r=PG\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Trixter</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Rave Movie Rundown</title>\n\t\t<link>https://trixter.oldskool.org/2015/08/14/rave-movie-rundown/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://trixter.oldskool.org/2015/08/14/rave-movie-rundown/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 15 Aug 2015 03:35:57 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Trixter]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://trixter.oldskool.org/?p=1340</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[I was a clubber in Chicago from 1988-1990. \u00a0(Medusa&#8217;s on Sheffield, anyone?) \u00a0I exited right when rave music was overtaking house music, but I caught the first wave for a tragically brief period and loved it: The transition from Kraftwerk to New Beat to Acid to Techno to EDM;

but unlike most fictional films that feature raves, Groove gets the feel of rave culture almost exactly right. \u00a0People aren&#8217;t dressed like\u00a0caricatures, the music is great, raves are busted by the police, only to spring up somewhere else the same night, the light drug use is portrayed accurately, etc. \u00a0Most importantly, the DJs are played by <strong>actual local DJs</strong> who spin their own music (Digweed shows up at the end to drop the entire place\u00a0to the ground with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rL1kXvfFhU\">Heaven Scent</a>). \u00a0The characters are\u00a0a little cliched, but is the most accurate (fictional) portrayal of American Rave culture I&#8217;ve seen.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want entertainment, see Groove; if you want historical accuracy, see Pump Up The Volume. \u00a0I highly recommend both.</p>\n<p>There are other rave culture movies. \u00a0They range from interesting\u00a0to\u00a0mostly bad. \u00a0Here is a partial list, in descending order of quality, with my subjective comments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekender_(film)\">Weekender</a>, 2011: \u00a0A fictional account of the early 1990s rave scene as rave migrated from Ibiza to the UK. \u00a0This particular movie centers around the Manchester scene as two friends try to turn raves into a business. \u00a0While this movie got bad reviews, I actually enjoyed it. \u00a0More importantly,\u00a0the early 1990s house music choices are mostly period-correct.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Midsummer_Night%27s_Rave\">A Midsummer Night&#8217;s Rave</a>, 2002: \u00a0An attempt to tell Shakespeare&#8217;s A Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream via rave culture. \u00a0The rave sections are fairly true, but the sound mixing is somewhat awful and a little distracting: The music mix isn&#8217;t loud enough during the dance scenes, so you hear their voices echo off the walls; just as distracting, the music is completely <strong>non-existent</strong> in the chillout room (there is <em>always </em>a dull thoom-thoom-thoom in the chillout room). \u00a0The actual storytelling is competent, being copied from Shakespeare. \u00a0An acquired taste.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rave_(film)\">Rave</a>, 2000: \u00a0An amateur effort. \u00a0Plot and characterization are cringe-worthy, as is most of the acting. \u00a0Despite the title, the rave is essentially a club with bouncers. \u00a0Avoid this one.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Stark Raving Mad</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Human Traffic</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Sample People</span>, and <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">One Perfect Day</span>\u00a0were initially on the list, but I took them off\u00a0because they portray clubs instead of traditional raves. \u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Go</span> is not on the list because I haven&#8217;t seen it yet.</p>\n<p>Did I miss any? \u00a0Disagree with my picks? \u00a0Leave me a comment.</p><br />Filed under: <a href='https://trixter.oldskool.org/category/uncategorized/'>Uncategorized</a>  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/trixter.wordpress.com/1340/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/trixter.wordpress.com/1340/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=trixter.oldskool.org&#038;blog=23286&#038;post=1340&#038;subd=trixter&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://trixter.oldskool.org/2015/08/14/rave-movie-rundown/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>3</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/95363aee12ad9bff5db2c4425b22b313?s=96&#38;d=retro&#38;r=PG\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Trixter</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Comedy gold in the Handy specification</title>\n\t\t<link>https://trixter.oldskool.org/2015/08/12/comedy-gold-in-the-handy-specification/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://trixter.oldskool.org/2015/08/12/comedy-gold-in-the-handy-specification/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 12 Aug 2015 16:30:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Trixter]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Gaming]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Programming]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Vintage Computing]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[gaming]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://trixter.oldskool.org/?p=1328</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The Atari Lynx\u00a0is my favorite handheld console. \u00a0Planning and design\u00a0started in 1986, long before the Nintendo Game\u00a0Boy, but development took long enough that it was actually released\u00a0half a year after\u00a0the Game\u00a0Boy. \u00a0Whether or not that makes it the first or second handheld console is up for discussion, but it was definitely one of the first [&#8230;]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=trixter.oldskool.org&#038;blog=23286&#038;post=1328&#038;subd=trixter&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Lynx\">Atari Lynx</a>\u00a0is my favorite handheld console. \u00a0Planning and design\u00a0started in 1986, long before the Nintendo Game\u00a0Boy, but development took long enough that it was actually released\u00a0half a year after\u00a0the Game\u00a0Boy. \u00a0Whether or not that makes it the first or second handheld console is up for discussion, but it was definitely one of the first two.</p>\n<p>History shows that the Lynx had an unsuccessful run compared to other handheld consoles of the time, which includes\u00a0the Game Boy, Game Gear, and\u00a0<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TurboExpress\">TurboExpress</a>. \u00a0Lynx&#8217;s failure in the market was split fairly evenly\u00a0between three culprits:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Price: $179 vs. Game Boy&#8217;s $100</li>\n<li>Battery life: It took 6 AAs to\u00a0power the unit for only 4 hours</li>\n<li>A\u00a0lack of compelling licensed or original titles</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The first hardware revision was also <a href=\"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/0IuS-VJtAJo/0.jpg\">somewhat large</a>, but as a guy with large hands, that never bothered me.</p>\n<p>There were some killer arcade ports to the Lynx that really showcased what the system was capable of, such as <a href=\"https://youtu.be/GzExaOYJ088?t=1m8s\">Road Blasters</a>, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/1LK6R3nDM7w?t=6m29s\">Stun Runner</a>, and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/zdgVqD-WZXg?t=19s\">Klax</a>. \u00a0But\u00a0these were ports of Atari games; Lynx never got the &#8220;big&#8221; licensees such as Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter (a double shame considering the Lynx supported true hardware multiplayer linkups).</p>\n<p>I recently sought out the Lynx hardware specification so that I could reminisce, sadly, about all of the untapped power Lynx had that was never realized. \u00a0The Lynx was so powerful that it shamed other handhelds\u00a0for nearly a decade <em><strong>after</strong> it was discontinued</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>4096-color palette</li>\n<li>Unlimited sprites with scaling, clipping, and collision (multiple modes!) all performed in hardware</li>\n<li>4-channel stereo sound supporting both algorithmic and sampled waveforms (in other words,\u00a0it could play both pure-hardware <a href=\"https://youtu.be/n9HBDihoUXo?t=31s\">chiptunes</a> <strong>and</strong> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6q_8VhUW6sk\">Amiga mods</a>)</li>\n<li>Multiplayer cable connections up to 8 simultaneous players/units</li>\n<li>Supported left-handed play via the ability to flip the screen</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There were other cool bits for the time it came out too, like a limited 32-bit math-coprocessor (used for some true 3-D polygon games like <a href=\"https://youtu.be/l85MTri3hvM?t=34s\">Hard Drivin&#8217;</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Iej5HJLd7Eg?t=13s\">Steel Talons</a>). \u00a0It wasn&#8217;t perfect; the system would\u00a0slow down if you pushed it too hard (too many sprites, too many sampled sounds playing simultaneously), but it was creative and ambitious.</p>\n<p>The Lynx started life as a hardware project by Epyx, initially called &#8220;Handy&#8221; (because it was to be the first handheld console). \u00a0Ex-Amigans RJ Mical and Dave Needle were involved in the design, which is why Handy feels like a tiny Amiga. \u00a0The initial specification was written in June of 1987 by Dave Needle. \u00a0Reading through it, two things are immediately evident:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The designers of Handy had a passion for creating a fun device with as many progammer assists as possible</li>\n<li>Dave had a wry sense of humor</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I will now\u00a0reproduce for you some of the comedy gold hiding in the Handy specification. \u00a0I&#8217;ve truncated some sequences for brevity, but the words are all Dave&#8217;s:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The human input controls consist of a 4 switch (8 position) joy stick, two sets of 2 independent fire buttons, game pause button, 2 flablode buttons. power on, and\u00a0power off&#8230;.Flablode is\u00a0a Jovian word meaning a device or function that we know is required or desired but for\u00a0which we don&#8217;t have an actual definition (noun: flabloden, verb: to flablode).</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p><strong>3. Software Related Hardware Perniciousness</strong><br />\n(or why some software people hate some hardware people)</p>\n<p>There are certain things that the software ought not to do to the hardware. While\u00a0these things are not physically destructive on their own, they will cause the hardware\u00a0to act unpredictably strange, which may cause the user to be physically destructive.\u00a0While we certainly could have protected the system from many of the following\u00a0problems, I doubt that we would have found them all. In addition, the act of software\u00a0doing one of these things means that there is a problem in the software anyway and the\u00a0intended function would probably not happen. Additionally, this is only a toy. If this\u00a0unit were a bio-medical device I would have found a safer solution.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p><strong>3.1 Don&#8217;t Do These Things.</strong></p>\n<p>If you do any of the things that I tell you not to do, the hardware will act\u00a0unpredictably and will not be expected to recover without a complete system\u00a0initialization. So don&#8217;t do them.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p><strong>3.1.5 Palettes and Page Breaks</strong></p>\n<p>This one is an actual hardware bug of mine&#8230;(much technical info removed)&#8230;Pen index\u00a0numbers C,D,E, and F will be incorrectly unchanged. Sometimes I am such a jerk.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p><strong>3.2 Please Don&#8217;t Do These Things.</strong></p>\n<p>There are also things that software people do that merely annoy the hardware\u00a0people rather than annoy the end user. This includes seemingly harmless activities\u00a0like sub-decoding bit values\u00a0from byte descriptions (sprite types, for instance), or\u00a0assuming address continuity between areas of hardware&#8230;Please don&#8217;t do them.\u00a0It would be difficult to list all of the possibilities, so I will list the general\u00a0considerations and ask you to be sensible about them. In addition, please feel free to\u00a0submit a request for an exemption-on a specific case. If it is granted, we will change\u00a0the specification so as to make the special case forever legal. The price will be small.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p><strong>3.3 Do It This Way</strong></p>\n<p>Some of the hardware functions, as designed by us mindless brutes, require\u00a0special handling. As we discover these requirements, I will list them here.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p><strong>4.3 CPU Sleep</strong></p>\n<p>BIG NOTE: Sleep is broken in Mikey. The CPU will NOT remain asleep unless Suzy is\u00a0using the bus. There is no point in putting the CPU to sleep unless you expect Suzy to\u00a0take the bus. We will figure out how to save power some other way.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>All hardware\u00a0collision detection is done with the data in the collision buffer, not the data in the video\u00a0buffer. This has obvious advantages and will be explained at seminars and in\u00a0newsletters forever&#8230;.In addition, the software can either do its own collision detection, or use the\u00a0contents of the collision buffer for some weird collision detection algorithm. In either\u00a0event, I will be mortally offended.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>In addition, this\u00a0means that when some of the bytes are not reloaded, the length of the SCB will be\u00a0smaller by the number of bytes not used. If I have said this in a confusing manner,\u00a0then I have.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>Well, I finally found the bug that required a pad byte of 0 at the end of each scan\u00a0line of data. But, It is actually 2 bugs. I have fixed one of them, but the other requires\u00a0an extensive change. Too bad, I am out of time. Therefore:\u00a0There is a bug in the hardware that requires that the last meaningful bit of the\u00a0data packet at the end of a scan line does not occur in the last bit of a byte (bit 0). This\u00a0means that the data packet creation process must check for this case, and if found,\u00a0must pad this data packet with a byte of all Os. Don&#8217;t forget to adjust the offset to\u00a0include this pad byte. Since this will only happen in 1/8 of the scan lines, it is not\u00a0enough overhead to force me to try to fix the bug. Sorry.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>This bit can be used to pause the\u00a0sprite engine. The &#8216;unsafe&#8217; condition of the internal registers is not directly\u00a0affected by this bit.</p>\n<p>I need to think about how to use it.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>Receive parity error can not be disabled. If you don&#8217;t want it, don&#8217;t read it&#8230;.We have just discovered that the calculation for parity includes the parity bit\u00a0itself. Most of us don&#8217;t like that, but it is too late to change it.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p><strong>11.7 Unusual Interrupt Condition</strong></p>\n<p>Well, we did screw something up after all. Both the transmit and receive\u00a0interrupts are &#8216;level&#8217; sensitive, rather than &#8216;edge&#8217; sensitive. This means that an\u00a0interrupt will be continuously generated as long as it is enabled and its UART buffer is\u00a0ready. As a result, the software must disable the interrupt prior to clearing it. Sorry.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p><strong>11.8 left out</strong></p>\n<p>I left something out. I know what it is but by the next time I revise this spec, I\u00a0may have forgotten.</p>\n<p>I have forgotten.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p><strong>12.1.4 Bugs in Mathland</strong></p>\n<p>BIG NOTE: There are several bugs in the multiply and divide hardware. Lets hope that\u00a0we do not get a chance to fix them.<br />\n1. In signed multiply, the hardware thinks that 8000 is a positive number.<br />\n2. In divide, the remainder will have 2 possible errors, depending on its actual\u00a0value. No point in explaining the errors here, just don&#8217;t use it. Thank You VTI.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p><strong>12.4 Qbert Root</strong></p>\n<p>As a compromise between the square root and qube root desires of the software people, and the schedule desires of the management, we have decided to incorporate the\u00a0function of QbertRoot. The required steps are:<br />\n1. Start a 16 by 16 multiply.<br />\n2. Immediately write to &#8216;E&#8217; which will try to start a divide.<br />\n3. Read the result from &#8220;D,C,B,A&#8217;.</p></blockquote>\n<p>(editor&#8217;s note: \u00a0I can&#8217;t tell if QbertRoot is an actual function, or trolling.)</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>16. Known Variances From Anticipated Optimums</strong><br />\nThis is a list of the known bugs in the hardware.</p>\n<p>&#8230;It will be OK to write to the twentyfour 16 bit registers of the Suzy SCB\u00a0PROVIDING that you only do it via the MACRO PROVIDED TO YOU BY RJ MICAL. In\u00a0addition, you must understand that the contents of this macro may change if future\u00a0revisions of the hardware so require. In addition, you must understand that future\u00a0hardware may make the process not work and therefore the macro will be changed to\u00a0be a warning that you can&#8217;t use it anymore.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t cheat.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My personal favorite, saved for last:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>7.3 Stereo</strong></p>\n<p>The 4 audio channels can be individually enabled into either of the two output\u00a0drivers. This is not now in the hardware. It may never get into the hardware. After\u00a0all, I hate music. However, since I acknowledge that I am wrong about some kinds of\u00a0music (in the right circumstances, with me not present) I have graciously allocated\u00a0one entire byte for the possible implementation of another useless and annoying sound\u00a0feature.</p></blockquote>\n<p>(For the record, that feature did go into the hardware, in the <a href=\"http://www.ausretrogamer.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Comparison_1.png\">second hardware revision</a>\u00a0of the Lynx. \u00a0If you have the later hardware, some audio is in true stereo.)</p>\n<p>If all hardware/technical documentation was written this way, I&#8217;d be an embedded systems programmer by now.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve scanned and OCR&#8217;d <a href=\"ftp://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/misc/Hardware/Atari/Lynx/\">the full Handy specification</a> for anyone wanting to learn more about the Lynx. \u00a0There&#8217;s a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene_compo\">compo</a>-winning demo hidden in the hardware, just waiting to be found.</p><br />Filed under: <a href='https://trixter.oldskool.org/category/gaming/'>Gaming</a>, <a href='https://trixter.oldskool.org/category/programming/'>Programming</a>, <a href='https://trixter.oldskool.org/category/technology/'>Technology</a>, <a href='https://trixter.oldskool.org/category/vintage-computing/'>Vintage Computing</a>  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/trixter.wordpress.com/1328/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/trixter.wordpress.com/1328/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=trixter.oldskool.org&#038;blog=23286&#038;post=1328&#038;subd=trixter&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://trixter.oldskool.org/2015/08/12/comedy-gold-in-the-handy-specification/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>1</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/95363aee12ad9bff5db2c4425b22b313?s=96&#38;d=retro&#38;r=PG\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Trixter</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Final version of 8088 MPH released</title>\n\t\t<link>https://trixter.oldskool.org/2015/08/02/final-version-of-8088-mph-released/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://trixter.oldskool.org/2015/08/02/final-version-of-8088-mph-released/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sun, 02 Aug 2015 20:24:40 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Trixter]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://trixter.oldskool.org/?p=1321</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The crew is happy to announce a final version of 8088 MPH.

quiet, haven&#8217;t I? \u00a0Truth be told, I got a little burnt out. \u00a0Winning Revision was a dream come true, but afterwards my free time and I really needed a break. \u00a0I ended up playing a LOT of games on the bucket list (Skyrim, Broken Age, replayed Fallout a 7th time) and generally caught\u00a0up on movies. \u00a0So, sorry I&#8217;ve been quiet.</p>\n<p>Some random interesting things that happened between then and now:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHXx3orN35Y\">The youtube video for 8088 MPH</a> surpassed 150K views, the most of any video I&#8217;ve posted. \u00a0Neat. \u00a0(I still like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdb3AQ14iVc\">the live version</a> better.)</li>\n<li>I was <a href=\"http://usesthis.com/interviews/jim.leonard/\">a featured creator</a> on The Setup.</li>\n<li>I was offered a <em>third</em>\u00a0job interview from\u00a0a company I would love to work for if my family wasn&#8217;t more important than my career whims.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since 8088 MPH, the crew has been working slowly but steadily on a final version that improves the sound and video quality a little, but more importantly, works on a wider range of hardware (ie. you should be able to use any CGA card instead of the first IBM revision). \u00a0Clone 6845 chips might also\u00a0be compatible with the final version; we&#8217;re working on it.</p>\n<p>As for me specifically:\u00a0Before the end of the summer, you will see at least one of the following three things from me:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>An article series exploring the PC speaker and how to thoroughly abuse it (has information relevant for other platforms too, most notably\u00a0lightweight compression/decompression schemes)</li>\n<li>A\u00a0method to much more easily enjoy vintage games on vintage systems</li>\n<li>A vintage PC podcast (I&#8217;m still flabbergasted there aren&#8217;t any!)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Suggestions welcome if you&#8217;d like to nudge me in a particular direction.</p><br />Filed under: <a href='https://trixter.oldskool.org/category/uncategorized/'>Uncategorized</a>  <a rel=\"nofollow\"

href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoparty\">demoparty</a> and compete in a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene_compo\">compo</a>. \u00a0<a href=\"http://www.slengpung.com/pics/NAID%20%2796/4150.jpg\">I</a> <a href=\"http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=2500\">competed</a> at <a href=\"http://www.pouet.net/party.php?which=159&amp;when=1996\">NAID &#8217;96</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pouet.net/party_results.php?which=159&amp;when=1996\">placed</a> there, which was awesome, but to compete with the best of the best, and win, has always been a dream of mine. \u00a0I&#8217;m happy to announce that after six months of hard work with good friends and extremely talented people, we achieved just that. \u00a0Our demo, <a href=\"http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=65371\">8088 MPH</a>, won the <a href=\"http://2015.revision-party.net/\">Revision 2015</a> oldskool demo compo. \u00a0(A personal victory for me was having it shown last in the compo, which is a sign of respect that the organizers think it&#8217;s the best high to end a compo in.) As of April 7th 2015, there are no IBM PC emulators in the world that can run the demo properly; they hang or crash before the demo is finished, and the colors are wrong. \u00a0Same goes for anything that isn&#8217;t the target hardware (see below). \u00a0To see what 8088 MPH looks like, I direct you to the video+audio capture of the demo running on real hardware: <iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/yHXx3orN35Y?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe> Because there are so many technological world-firsts in the demo, and because we&#8217;re bending the hardware in ways that people have never thought to do so, it&#8217;s only fair that we try to explain exactly how this was achieved. \u00a0One of my roles was &#8220;organizer&#8221; for the demo, so I&#8217;ll break it down scene by scene, covering the basics of each trick. \u00a0For parts that I wrote, I go into some\u00a0detail, but for a deep technical dive into certain areas, I&#8217;ll keep this blog entry updated to point to reenigne&#8217;s, VileR&#8217;s, and Scali&#8217;s blog posts about their parts. \u00a0It is our hope that these discussions will foster revived &#8220;old-school&#8221; interest in software development for the platform.

I should also note here that there were <a href=\"http://www.reenigne.org/blog/comparison-of-cga-card-versions/\">two different versions of IBM CGA</a> produced, which differ mainly\u00a0in how composite colors are generated. \u00a0We had equal numbers of both &#8220;old&#8221; and &#8220;new&#8221; style IBM CGA cards, so we chose to compose graphics for the &#8220;old&#8221; style. \u00a0If you have the &#8220;new&#8221; style CGA card, the demo will still run, but the colors will be off slightly.</p>\n<h1>Technical Breakdown</h1>\n<h2>Development tools used</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Turbo C</li>\n<li>Turbo Pascal</li>\n<li>Turbo Assembler</li>\n<li>Turbo Debugger</li>\n<li>Visual C++</li>\n<li>OpenWatcom</li>\n<li>NASM (and YASM)</li>\n<li>DOSBox</li>\n<li>A few real IBM 5160s (hardware equivalent to the 5150, but easier to find in the real world)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any data files were directly included in the .exe/.com files themselves. \u00a0This kept everything together in the same binary which means the data could benefit from compression (see below). Most development cycles involved designing in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetware_%28brain%29\">wetware</a>, coding on a modern system (or DOSBox running on a modern system), testing/debugging in DOSBox,\u00a0and then transferring over to real hardware for a final test. \u00a0Once\u00a0an effect grew so sophisticated it couldn&#8217;t run in an emulator any more, this cycle slowed down as testing could only be done on real hardware. \u00a0Various transfer methods were used to get code to real hardware: \u00a0Scali used a serial cable; I used an ethernet card running a packet driver and <a href=\"http://www.brutman.com/mTCP/\">mTCP</a>; at the party we used an 8-bit IDE ISA adapter (Silicon Valley ADP-50) connected to a CF-to-IDE adapter to make a CF card the hard drive, then used a USB CF card reader to move stuff back and forth. \u00a0The most intriguing method of all was reenigne&#8217;s method, who used\u00a0a custom controller connected to the keyboard port that used the IBM BIOS factory test mode as a poor-man&#8217;s serial port. \u00a0(I hope Andrew writes up some details on that!)</p>\n<h2>Loader, API, and general structure</h2>\n<p>We all had different preferred development languages and environments, so it was decided early on to create an overseeing &#8220;loader&#8221; that would execute .EXE and .COM files, and then people could develop effects in whatever environment they wanted to. \u00a0This is not a new concept; the famous <a href=\"http://fabiensanglard.net/second_reality/second_reality_dis.php\">Second Reality demo did this for exactly the same reasons</a>, and the same technique was used even earlier than that on numerous demos on other platforms. \u00a0(Before you ask: No, <a href=\"https://github.com/fabiensanglard/SecondReality\">the Second Reality code</a> was not copied; in fact, it wasn&#8217;t even consulted, as we had to write extremely tight code to minimize memory usage, and also have it work on an 8088 (the Second Reality code uses 80186 opcodes). \u00a0The loader API services assemble to about\u00a0450 bytes of code. The loader, as designed, would be responsible for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Playing music in the background</li>\n<li>Masking the load times and precalc times of various effects using &#8220;megademo&#8221;-style text</li>\n<li>Providing synchronization services (such as providing a vertical-retrace interrupt in software, and a user-definable countdown timer)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Running effects with the loader consisted of this workflow:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Print text on the screen and animate it using an interrupt and the 6845 start address register</li>\n<li>Execute the effect</li>\n<li>The effect would decompress, perform precalc, etc. and then signal the loader it is ready to start</li>\n<li>The loader cleans up the moving onscreen text, then signal the effect it can start</li>\n<li>Effect starts, magic occurs</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Designing this correctly was extremely important, as any bugs would derail the entire thing. \u00a0It was designed fully before even a single line of code was written. \u00a0I&#8217;ve <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1645juVSRF2M2shcpZ3sOXHiugm0uUP7kOgHHzHzp4AQ/edit?usp=sharing\">shared\u00a0the design doc online</a> for the curious. \u00a0(I wrote the loader.) The background music playback had to be as simple as possible so as to not interfere with any effects. \u00a0A single PC beep, changing (or silencing) once every frame, was the only thing that was practical, so 60Hz beeping is what the background music consists of. \u00a0The composition program used for generating the speaker timer values was <a href=\"http://www.oldskool.org/pc/MONOTONE\">MONOTONE</a>. \u00a0Even though the code for playback is only 18\u00a0lines of assembler, it takes up two scanlines onscreen, so you can see how anything even slightly\u00a0more complicated would have sucked much more CPU out of the system and some of the full-screen 60Hz effects simply would not have been possible.</p>\n<h2>Executable compression</h2>\n<p>Another decision early on was to see if executable compression was feasible, which means the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Does it actually compress things small enough to be worthwhile?</li>\n<li>Is the decompression quick enough to avoid long pauses in the demo?</li>\n<li>Does the decompression routine affect the system while it decompresses? (ie. does it disable interrupts or something else equally horrible while it decompresses, which would trash the demo?)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I gathered\u00a0most classic and modern <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_compression\">executable compressors</a> and ran tests against old programs that were representative of what we would be producing. \u00a0The results were welcome surprises. \u00a0The compression ratios were good enough that we could afford to include precalc&#8217;d data instead of calculating it on the fly, and the decompression was fast enough that the total end-to-end time loading a program from diskette was actually slightly faster than if it were to load uncompressed. \u00a0In the end, pklite emerged as the winner. \u00a0I&#8217;ve <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xrZ81AqnRyje98z2QORzeOw28LGh2_wGrF3p6fozicY/edit?usp=sharing\">shared the comparison data online</a> for comparison. \u00a0(If I missed any packers that hold <strong>substantial</strong> advantages over the ones in the data, please let me know what they are. \u00a0There were nearly 100 packers made for DOS, but unless they compress smaller than apack or upx, or decompress faster than pklite or lzexe &#8212; <em>all while remaining compatible with 8088</em> &#8212; then I don&#8217;t want to hear about them.)</p>\n<h2>Scene-by-scene\u00a0breakdown</h2>\n<p>What follows is a screen-by-screen explanation\u00a0of each effect. \u00a0As previously stated, I&#8217;ll only describe scenes in detail if I wrote them; it will be up to the others if they want to write a technical breakdown for their parts. \u00a0The explanation for each effect follows after the effect&#8217;s screenshot. <a href=\"https://trixter.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/mph_screenhots-avi-still001.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1257 aligncenter\" src=\"https://trixter.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/mph_screenhots-avi-still001.png?w=660&#038;h=440\" alt=\"mph_screenhots.avi.Still001\" width=\"660\" height=\"440\" /></a> The\u00a0introduction was meant to serve two purposes: \u00a0To educate the audience on the system and explain at just how much of a disadvantage we were trying to make a world-class demo on such hardware, and also simultaneously shatter their expectations :-) \u00a0The text mode is obviously simulated; I essentially duplicated the basic BIOS functions for handling text mode but simulated in graphics mode. \u00a0The cursor blinking and text blinking\u00a0are handled identically to how the 6845 does it,\u00a0adding to the illusion. It is (nearly) impossible to change the display\u00a0start address of graphics mode such that every single scanline comes from a different place, so the title screen unrolling was done brute force, by copying new scanlines into memory hidden by retrace. \u00a0The title screen goes\u00a0away with a &#8220;fade&#8221; on the top edge by ANDing a mask on successive lines of the screen data. <a href=\"https://trixter.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/mph_screenhots-avi-still002.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1258 aligncenter\" src=\"https://trixter.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/mph_screenhots-avi-still002.png?w=660&#038;h=440\" alt=\"mph_screenhots.avi.Still002\" width=\"660\" height=\"440\" /></a> A lot of people think the title screen is the same picture <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VPn5gkG_Qo\">demonstrated by VileR a few years ago</a>. \u00a0It&#8217;s not! \u00a0He recomposed it for 16-color composite specifically for this demo, and changed it subtlety as well. <a href=\"https://trixter.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/mph_screenhots-avi-still003.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1259 aligncenter\" src=\"https://trixter.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/mph_screenhots-avi-still003.png?w=660&#038;h=440\" alt=\"mph_screenhots.avi.Still003\" width=\"660\" height=\"440\" /></a> The bobbing was achieved by creating a software vertical retrace interrupt that fired at the same place onscreen every time (just after the last displayed line) and then hooking it with a 6845 display start address change routine. \u00a0Flags were used to communicate to the interrupt if it was time to erase the letters, which was done by simply using REP STOSW to fill screen memory with black lines. \u00a0Because the 6845 displays two onscreen rows per &#8220;row&#8221;, the text could only move to even lines, which is why the movement isn&#8217;t as smooth as it could be. \u00a0Well, to be fair, it <em>could</em> be made to move to any line we wanted, but doing so would be CPU intensive, and the whole point of the loader is to use as little CPU as possible, so this was the compromise. The simulated vertical retrace interrupt was provided through loader API services for the rest of the effects to use as well. \u00a0Effects could disable it, re-initialize it, and hook/unhook their own routines to it. <a href=\"https://trixter.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/mph_screenhots-avi-still004.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1260 aligncenter\" src=\"https://trixter.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/mph_screenhots-avi-still004.png?w=660&#038;h=440\" alt=\"mph_screenhots.avi.Still004\" width=\"660\" height=\"440\" /></a> The moire (interference pattern) effect was achieved using a base of 40&#215;25 text mode, the half-char block extended ASCII characters, and lots of unrolled code. \u00a0The circles were chosen to represent the classic effect, but in reality the effect can combine any two images. \u00a0reenigne&#8217;s effect. <a href=\"https://trixter.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/mph_screenhots-avi-still005.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1261 aligncenter\" src=\"https://trixter.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/mph_screenhots-avi-still005.png?w=660&#038;h=440\" alt=\"mph_screenhots.avi.Still005\" width=\"660\" height=\"440\" /></a> The rotozoomer is the same tired old routine I first rolled out in 1996 in the <a href=\"http://www.pouet.net/party.php?which=204&amp;when=1996\">8086 compo</a>, but optimized to the hilt and sped up by only drawing every other line. \u00a0A miscommunication between me and VileR resulted in probably not the best texture to demonstrate the effect, but it still runs well enough. \u00a0There were plans to include a 60 Hz version of this effect, but we ran out of time. <a href=\"https://trixter.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/mph_screenhots-avi-still006.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1262 aligncenter\" src=\"https://trixter.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/mph_screenhots-avi-still006.png?w=660&#038;h=440\" alt=\"mph_screenhots.avi.Still006\" width=\"660\" height=\"440\" /></a> The core concept of the 1024-color mode is a serious abuse of 80&#215;25 text mode with the NTSC colorburst turned on. \u00a0VileR made the first discovery with 512 colors, and reenigne was able to double this to 1024 with CRTC trickery. Some people thought the entire demo was in this mode. \u00a0It was not, because 80-column text mode suffers from the famous <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_Graphics_Adapter#Limitations.2C_bugs_and_errata\">CGA &#8220;snow&#8221; defect</a> when you write directly to CGA RAM in this mode. \u00a0This is unfortunately visible in the plasma effect (see below). BTW, when I saw this picture in 2013, that&#8217;s when I knew I had to\u00a0get all these people together to make a demo. \u00a0I mean, geezus, look at it! \u00a0My jaw dropped when I saw it. \u00a0Had I never seen VileR&#8217;s collaboration with reenigne to make the above, 8088 MPH might never have existed. <a href=\"https://trixter.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/mph_screenhots-avi-still007.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1263 aligncenter\" src=\"https://trixter.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/mph_screenhots-avi-still007.png?w=660&#038;h=440\" alt=\"mph_screenhots.avi.Still007\" width=\"660\" height=\"440\" /></a> These stars were actually the result of unrolled code and a precalc&#8217;d table that, together, take a byte from one location and moves it to another position in video RAM. \u00a0While we had other patterns ready, such as a swirling display, we felt the starfield was most appropriate for a typical &#8220;oldskool&#8221; demo. \u00a0reenigne&#8217;s effect. <a href=\"https://trixter.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/mph_screenhots-avi-still008.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1264 aligncenter\" src=\"https://trixter.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/mph_screenhots-avi-still008.png?w=660&#038;h=440\" alt=\"mph_screenhots.avi.Still008\" width=\"660\" height=\"440\" /></a> The sprite part seems like black magic, but is the combination of using a sprite compiler written by Scali, and adjusting\u00a0the screen vertically using the 6845 start address register. \u00a0CGA only has one screen&#8217;s worth of video memory, so moving the address down scrolls the screen up, with the data repeating across the boundary. \u00a0The data doesn&#8217;t repeat evenly across the boundary, however, requiring handling. \u00a0The timer was monitored to know when the screen line containing the last pixel of the sprite had been drawn, which prompted redrawing the sprite. \u00a0(In other words, re-drawing the sprite was an exercise in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_the_Beam:_The_Atari_Video_Computer_System\">racing the beam</a>.) \u00a0Timing was very tight to avoid screen/sprite tearing effects. <a href=\"https://trixter.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/mph_screenhots-avi-still009.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1265 aligncenter\" src=\"https://trixter.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/mph_screenhots-avi-still009.png?w=660&#038;h=440\" alt=\"mph_screenhots.avi.Still009\" width=\"660\" height=\"440\" /></a> Also part of the compiled sprite effect, this displays 30 vectorballs at 30 Hz. \u00a0We had an earlier display that used less balls to achieve 60 Hz, but Scali had the idea at the last minute to make them spell out something like &#8220;8088&#8221;, &#8220;IBM&#8221;, etc. and coded up the change at the party. \u00a0The update is done using double-buffering; the sprites only take up a small rectangular area onscreen, so the screen mode&#8217;s CRTC settings were reprogrammed to provide a video mode with a small area in the middle of the physical screen, using only half of available video memory. \u00a0This provided a true hidden page to draw/erase vectorballs to, which was then flipped to be visible using the 6845 display start address register. <a href=\"https://trixter.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/mph_screenhots-avi-still010.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1266 aligncenter\" src=\"https://trixter.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/mph_screenhots-avi-still010.png?w=660&#038;h=440\" alt=\"mph_screenhots.avi.Still010\" width=\"660\" height=\"440\" /></a> Using a 1024-color variant screen mode that could be updated using only the attribute byte (thereby limiting the number of colors to 256), this plasma had to perform writes only when the CRT beam was retracing horizontally or vertically. \u00a0Unfortunately, the timing required to get this right stopped working at the party for some reason (probably happened as we were rearranging effect order), and as a result you can see a line of noise along the left side of the screen, and a little bit of noise\u00a0at the top. \u00a0This was my fault, as I wrote the effect using a somewhat lazy polling routine. \u00a0It&#8217;s a shame CGA snow exists, because without all the retrace handling to avoid it, this effect runs at 60fps. \u00a0In the demo with snow avoidance, it runs at only 20fps. \u00a0VileR may write more about how this screen mode and color system is\u00a0constructed, and if so, I&#8217;ll update the links at the top of this article to point to the method. If we come out with a final version of the demo, fixing this is at the top of the priority list. \u00a0In fact, I&#8217;m betting reenigne could change this from a polling effect to a cycle-counting effect, which would not only fix the snow, but speed it up. <a href=\"https://trixter.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/mph_screenhots-avi-still011.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1267 aligncenter\" src=\"https://trixter.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/mph_screenhots-avi-still011.png?w=660&#038;h=440\" alt=\"mph_screenhots.avi.Still011\" width=\"660\" height=\"440\" /></a> The 1024-color mode reprograms the start address every two lines. \u00a0I took advantage of this behavior to create a simple &#8220;drip&#8221; effect for VileR&#8217;s amazing artwork. \u00a0Already you can posit\u00a0that much more complicated effects are possible (thinking of <a href=\"http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=2048\">the Copper demo</a> here) but I ran out of time to make it more awesome. <a href=\"https://trixter.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/mph_screenhots-avi-still012.png\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-1268 aligncenter\" src=\"https://trixter.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/mph_screenhots-avi-still012.png?w=660&#038;h=440\" alt=\"mph_screenhots.avi.Still012\" width=\"660\" height=\"440\" /></a> This classic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_bar\">Kefrens bars effect</a> was done by reenigne in 320x200x4 mode. \u00a0It&#8217;s a cycle-counting effect, as there is simply no time to monitor for horizontal retrace. \u00a0To ensure the cycle counting was consistent, several things were done including changing the system default DRAM refresh from it&#8217;s default interval of 18 to 19, to get the DRAM refresh periods to line up with CRTC accesses. <a href=\"https://trixter.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/mph_screenhots-avi-still013.png\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-1269 aligncenter\" src=\"https://trixter.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/mph_screenhots-avi-still013.png?w=660&#038;h=440\" alt=\"mph_screenhots.avi.Still013\" width=\"660\" height=\"440\" /></a> This was Scali&#8217;s effect and inspired by his <a href=\"http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=62165\">1991 demo</a> which also featured a large torus. \u00a0There are several things going on here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Only changed portions of the screen are calculated and drawn, to minimize the amount of bandwidth needed to update the screen (this is the same &#8220;delta drawing&#8221; idea used in <a href=\"https://x86dc.wordpress.com/\">XDC</a>). \u00a0This was done because CGA video memory has a wait state, so the less you need to write to it, the better.</li>\n<li>320x200x4 mode is used with a background and palette combination that gives this specific composite color palette, which included many shades of blue.</li>\n<li>To help with the shading, dithering is applied during rasterization.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://trixter.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/mph_screenhots-avi-still014.png\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-1270 aligncenter\" src=\"https://trixter.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/mph_screenhots-avi-still014.png?w=660&#038;h=440\" alt=\"mph_screenhots.avi.Still014\" width=\"660\" height=\"440\" /></a> At the party, reenigne posited that it should be possible to restart the CRTC start address every single scanline. \u00a0This would result in a video mode that was only 100 lines high, and\u00a0would give a 80&#215;100 resolution 1024-color mode. \u00a0The above is the result of that coding, plus <strong>really extensive</strong>\u00a0work done on a CGA NTSC composite signal modeling program done by reenigne months earlier to perform the image conversion. \u00a0(No, you can&#8217;t have it. \u00a0And before you ask, the &#8220;girl&#8221; and &#8220;CGA 1k&#8221; pictures were not stock conversions, but were hand-pixeled by VileR in Photoshop, and the 4-colors/16-colors/&#8221;Until Now&#8221; screens in a customized version of Pablodraw he created.) We didn&#8217;t have time to put text into this picture, so the people you see above are the same as in credits order: \u00a0Trixter, reenigne, Scali, VileR, Phoenix, and virt. \u00a0Apologies to coda and puppeh, but as you can see, any more squishing and the faces would have been unrecognizable. \u00a0Sorry! <a href=\"https://trixter.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/mph_screenhots-avi-still015.png\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-1271 aligncenter\" src=\"https://trixter.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/mph_screenhots-avi-still015.png?w=660&#038;h=440\" alt=\"mph_screenhots.avi.Still015\" width=\"660\" height=\"440\" /></a> Finally, the coup de gr\u00e2ce: \u00a0A multichannel music engine for the PC speaker. \u00a0We didn&#8217;t want to just copy a ZX Spectrum engine, nor other engines such as the one used in Music Construction Set, but rather set the bar impossibly high by playing a protracker mod through the speaker. \u00a0Other modplayers for the speaker already exist, but they require a 10 MHz 80286, and can barely manage output at a 6KHz sampling rate. \u00a0Ours faithfully reproduces all protracker effects, mixing and outputting to the speaker realtime at 16.5 KHz, all on a 4.77 MHz CPU. This was reenigne&#8217;s baby, and is a truly stunning technical achievement that required unconventional thinking and considerable 8088 knowledge to pull off. \u00a0I&#8217;m sure he will write up a more detailed post on how it was done. \u00a0Until then, I can mention the following details:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Preconversion of the module was necessary to align data structures and sample data to be favorable to how the 8088 indexes memory. \u00a0Sample data is also converted.</li>\n<li>Each sample must take exactly 288 cycles to calculate and output or else the sound goes completely pants. \u00a0This was very difficult to achieve. \u00a04.77 MHz / 288 = 16572 Hz sample output.</li>\n<li>Audio output was done using traditional <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation\">Pulse-Width Modulation</a> (PWM) techniques, such as the kind made popular by Access&#8217;s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealSound\">Realsound</a>. \u00a0PC speaker PWM is performed by tying the PC speaker input pin to the programmable interrupt timer&#8217;s (PIT) channel 2, then programming PIT 2 for byte value one-shot mode. \u00a0Any value sent to PIT 2 with the system configured like this will set the speaker HIGH and start a count, and when the count expires (ie. the sent value is reached), the speaker goes LOW again. \u00a0This results in an audible carrier wave &#8220;whine&#8221;, which was why the output needed to be fast (16.5 KHz) so that the carrier wave was above the range of human hearing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Fun fact: \u00a0After preconversion of the song and being turned into a self-playing .exe, the final result is smaller after compression\u00a0than the size of the original source module.</p>\n<h2>Party Sprint</h2>\n<p>At the party, we came with something that was 90% finished. \u00a0Prior to arriving at the party, we created what we thought was a decent entry, and created two &#8220;failsafe&#8221; videos, one that was a capture for the bigscreen and another that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4dtJbb6Eow\">showed the demo running on real hardware as verification for the judges</a>. \u00a0We were worried that the hardware we were bringing would get damaged in transit, so this was a precaution so that we could enter <em>something</em> if that happened. \u00a0Thankfully, reenigne&#8217;s and Scali&#8217;s IBM\u00a05160s arrived unharmed (which was especially remarkable since reenigne had to bring his from the UK to Germany on a series of trains!). \u00a0We also brought two CGA cards, and two capture devices, and three different methods of exchanging new software bits from our laptops to the old hardware. \u00a0<strong>You can never be too prepared!</strong> Most of the coding time at the party was spent adding the kefrens and ending portrait picture, eliminating bugs from each part where possible, adding nice transitions where possible, shaving seconds off of each part to stay within the compo limit, and rearranging\u00a0parts so that virt&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.backtothefuture.com/\">BTTF</a>-inspired tune&#8217;s intro lined up with the sprite part. \u00a0We spent pretty much all our time before the compo coding, eating, or visiting the bathroom, and only had time to socialize after that. While we came mostly prepared for something that was worthy of entering the compo, the time spent at the party was invaluable for turning a rough draft into something that could really compete for first place. \u00a0Having all four of us at the same table meant we could collaborate instantly. \u00a0So, lesson learned: \u00a0There are rarely substitutes for working together in person! \u00a0One of the biggest improvements of &#8220;party collaborating&#8221;\u00a0was the decision to change the credits from a variable-speed, text-only scrolling to a more evenly-paced, ANSI-style scrolling, which I think was the best implementation change\u00a0compared to\u00a0the bits we brought from home. To help save time (and to ensure the video was converted well &#8212;\u00a0sorry, but most people don&#8217;t know how to deal with interlaced video properly), I offered to provide Gasman with a 720@60p video. \u00a0The NTSC output of CGA is slightly off; instead of 262.5 lines\u00a0per field, it generates\u00a0262. \u00a0This means it generates 59.92 fields (29.96 frames) per second instead of the NTSC broadcast standard of 59.94 (29.97 fps). \u00a0This throws off most modern capture devices; Scali\u00a0had access to a high-quality Blackmagic Intensity Shuttle, for example, but it couldn&#8217;t lock onto the signal. \u00a0I knew\u00a0from experience that some cheap\u00a0video capture devices, such as the Terratec Grabby or the Dazzle DVC100, have extra tolerance built into them as they were designed to be used with VCR sources, so I bought a few and sent one to reenigne for testing. \u00a0For the capture, we used a DVC100 with some slight proc amp adjustments so that the capture looked as close to the\u00a0CRT monitor output as possible. \u00a0To further ensure better video capturing, we used VirtualDub for the capture software, which has an option to dynamically resample the input audio source to fit the capture framerate you are aiming\u00a0for in case it&#8217;s slightly off, and the software and hardware combination worked very well. \u00a0For grabbing the audio, we initially <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzMZeWFSs1E\">tapped the\u00a0speaker with alligator clips</a>, but Scali brought his Sound Blaster which had a real PC speaker tap you could hook up with an internal cable, so we used that for the final capture.</p>\n<h1>Looking to the future</h1>\n<p>After watching the demo and reading the above, you may be wondering if there is actually room for improvement. \u00a0Believe it or not, there is: \u00a0Alternative methods of sound generation and additional cycle-exact trickery are definitely possible. \u00a0We had more effects to put into the demo, but ran out of time: \u00a0We ran out of development time, and we also ran out of execution time, as the Revision compo limit was 8 minutes or less. I&#8217;ve known everyone who has worked on the demo collectively over 60 years. \u00a0It was an honor and a privilege to work with them all to produce this demo. \u00a0Will we work together again? \u00a0I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s definitely possible; the day after the compo, we threw around some ideas, such as making a game next instead of a demo. \u00a0Me personally, I&#8217;m burnt out and will be spending the next few weeks playing some games I&#8217;ve always wanted to finish, and working on my health. \u00a0I also have some other large projects I want to get kickstarted this summer, such as something the PC software preservation movement desperately needs, and\u00a0an online sound card museum. \u00a0But hey, who knows.</p>\n<h1>Blogosphere Coverage and Discussions</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a

/>]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SNATCHIT is a program written in the 1980s that loads COPYIIPC (a protected-disk copying program) and then interacts with it runtime to provide disk image saving and loading (features it did not ship with because such features expressly encouraged software piracy). \u00a0We used this in the 80s to transfer protected disk images around BBSes until someone could figure out how to crack the game and release it properly.</p>\n<p>I recently had a need to run SNATCHIT on a 1GHz system. \u00a0I recycled an old system to become a box for dumping all my media, from floppy disks to memory cards to hard drives, something that can do it in the background without tying up my main machine. Because it&#8217;s a 1GHz system, SNATCHIT won&#8217;t run,\u00a0even with hardware and software slowdowns. \u00a0I wanted to run it there because I have some 3.5&#8243; protected disks I want to\u00a0preserve, so I investigated patching it to work around whatever is tripping it up. \u00a0It&#8217;s a .COM file, the very easiest type of executable program for old PCs to reverse-engineer, debug, and patch &#8212; should be easy, right?</p>\n<p>When I try to debug SNATCHIT.COM,\u00a0I see it&#8217;s encrypted. Okay, not totally unexpected; simple encryption schemes were common at that time. \u00a0Let&#8217;s try patching it to decrypt and continue&#8230; \u00a0Okay, now it exploits a HLT bug to, I guess, fool debuggers (I didn&#8217;t see any PIC code disabling hardware interrupts, but whatever, maybe it was only partially implemented). \u00a0Loading in the DOSBOX debugger bypassed that.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Protip</strong>: As soon as you\u00a0see anti-debugger tricks in something you&#8217;re\u00a0debugging, bypass all of them by loading the program into an emulator debugger (such as the DOSBOX debugger). \u00a0This is an advantage that 25 years has given our hobby; in the 80s and 90s, the best we had was something like SoftICE, which wasn&#8217;t foolproof. \u00a0Running in an emulator debugger view is fantastic because the target program has no idea it is being inspected.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Work continued. \u00a0In a neat trick that I don&#8217;t fully understand yet, I found\u00a0that on real hardware it puts a certain value in a register, but in the DOSBOX debugger it puts the wrong value and locks up. I don&#8217;t quite understand why, but DOSBox debugger lets me force a value, so\u00a0I forced the correct value and kept going&#8230;</p>\n<p>An hour later, I was tearing my hair out. \u00a0SNATCHIT, in that fine software pirate impress-your-friends-and-bury-your-enemies\u00a0tradition, has multiple sections that decrypt, but not all at once, argh! \u00a0(In a pirate voice: &#8220;aarrrrrgh!&#8221;) \u00a0I had some of it decrypted in non-contiguous chunks, enough to see this:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\">\r\ndb '(C) Copyright 1991, Software Pirates, INC.'\r\ndb ' Software Pirates will try to fool you'\r\ndb 'and hide code that you cannot find'\r\ndb 'and then decode it and then execute'\r\ndb 'this is to fake out the opposi$$$n,'\r\n</pre>\n<p>&#8230;and later:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\">\r\n; anything in (parenthesis) is not in the text, but implied\r\n\r\ndb '(they think) that they are smarter than us but no one can ever b'\r\ndb 'the infamous programmers that bring you the new and'\r\ndb 'fangled code thatknocks your socksoff and stinks up'\r\ndb 'the room and probbly your computeralso. Sometimes t(he)'\r\ndb 'best way to beat them is to look t(hem)'\r\ndb 'straight in the eye and ask them w!' (why) \r\n</pre>\n<p>Great. Later, the somewhat ominous:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\">\r\nseg000:01D4 db 'PARITY ERROR, Continuing processing.',0Ah\r\n</pre>\n<p>Not only should that wording strike fear into your heart (parity errors are a BAD THING that should NOT CONTINUE PROCESSING), but this message proves they&#8217;re redirecting the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-maskable_interrupt\">NMI</a> at some point.

I&#8217;ll see you again. Someday.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Without knowing why Sam is leaving, this\u00a0reads like a suicide note. \u00a0</strong>Imagine the horror in my wife&#8217;s face as she missed the relevant journal entry by accident and arrived at this ending.</p>\n<p>The good thing about this unintended consequence is that\u00a0Gone Home can now officially be called a &#8220;real&#8221; game, as a\u00a0player choice can result in a second\u00a0ending.</p>\n<p>Well, there&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.dorkly.com/video/58404/gun-home\">a third ending</a>\u00a0too, but you&#8217;ll need guns. \u00a0Lots of guns.</p><br />Filed under: <a href='https://trixter.oldskool.org/category/gaming/'>Gaming</a>  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/trixter.wordpress.com/1227/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/trixter.wordpress.com/1227/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=trixter.oldskool.org&#038;blog=23286&#038;post=1227&#038;subd=trixter&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://trixter.oldskool.org/2015/02/02/gone-homes-horrifying-second-ending/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>1</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/95363aee12ad9bff5db2c4425b22b313?s=96&#38;d=retro&#38;r=PG\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Trixter</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Sony Xperia Z3v impressions and workarounds</title>\n\t\t<link>https://trixter.oldskool.org/2015/01/10/sony-xperia-z3v-impressions-and-workarounds/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://trixter.oldskool.org/2015/01/10/sony-xperia-z3v-impressions-and-workarounds/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2015 21:17:59 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Trixter]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Digital Video]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://trixter.oldskool.org/?p=1209</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The Xperia Z3v is a very odd hybrid of a phone that is being marketed as a\u00a0flagship for the current generation of smartphones;

it was released in October 2014 and is a Verizon exclusive\u00a0(other carriers have the older Z2 or Z3). \u00a0There is a nearly criminal lack of coverage in the media for this phone, so I thought I&#8217;d rectify that with my thoughts on the phone after two months of use. \u00a0First, some background:</p>\n<p>We switched the entire family over from Sprint to Verizon (more expensive, but you get what you pay for) and part of the terms of the switch was that we all get new phones. \u00a0As I was a long-time Samsung customer (Epic 4G, Galaxy S4) I was planning on going with the S5, but wanted a few things the S5 couldn&#8217;t give me, like stereo front-facing speakers. \u00a0After reviewing everything Verizon offered that met my requirements, I decided to try the Xperia Z3v under the agreement that I could return it after 14 days if I wanted to switch to another phone. \u00a0Because the phone is best-in-class in a few areas, I&#8217;ve decided to keep it, accepting\u00a0that a few aspects of the phone\u00a0need workarounds.</p>\n<p>The Z3v is a combination of the Z2 (larger, thicker body; slower CPU) and the Z3 (camera, screen). \u00a0It&#8217;s a frankenphone that only Verizon offers. \u00a0Let&#8217;s start by describing the basic features of the phone that drew me to it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>20 megapixel\u00a0camera sensor</li>\n<li>1080@60p and\u00a04K@30 video recording</li>\n<li>IP65/68 rating (dustproof, waterproof up to 5 feet for up to 30 minutes)</li>\n<li>Front-facing stereo speakers</li>\n<li>Dedicated physical camera shutter button</li>\n<li>Wireless charging</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(It has more features than these obviously, like remote PS4 playing, but these are the only ones that interested me.) \u00a0Sounds awesome right? \u00a0Well, it mostly is. \u00a0Based on my experience, here&#8217;s what &#8220;mostly awesome&#8221;\u00a0means:</p>\n<h1>Pros</h1>\n<p><strong>The camera.</strong> \u00a0As a point&#8217;n&#8217;shoot, the Z3v is one of the best I&#8217;ve ever had. \u00a0The 20mp sensor, coupled with firmware borrowed from the Sonty CyberShot line of cameras means that it shoots great automatic pictures. \u00a0In default &#8220;auto&#8221; mode, which is what you get if you press the camera shutter button to wake up the phone and go straight to the camera app, it uses the 20MP sensor to oversample the scene and provide both free HDR shots and stabilization. \u00a0It is smart enough to turn off stabilization if it notices the camera is on a tripod, and tells you it is doing so with a small status indicator. \u00a0Actually, it&#8217;s smart enough to do all sorts of things that I won&#8217;t bother mentioning here &#8212; just know that the Z3v is good enough that I don&#8217;t carry a dedicated camera any more. \u00a0Is it a replacement for a DSLR? \u00a0No, of course not. \u00a0But it is <strong>definitely </strong>a replacement for a sub-$300 point&#8217;n&#8217;shoot. \u00a0The shutter button even performs a press-half-to-focus-lock, press-full-to-shoot function.</p>\n<p><strong>4k video.</strong> \u00a0Being able to shoot this is not terribly practical, but it <strong>does </strong>work, and you do see some additional fine detail that you don&#8217;t see in 1080p mode. \u00a04K mode is useful if you can&#8217;t decide on the framing of a 1080p shot and you want the ability to crop without losing detail. \u00a0It works best outdoors; there&#8217;s no point in using it in low light.</p>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s waterproof.</strong> \u00a0Will I be shooting underwater? \u00a0No. \u00a0Will I be secretly grateful that my accidental fumble of the phone into the toilet won&#8217;t completely destroy it? \u00a0Absolutely.</p>\n<p><strong>Active noise-canceling for free.</strong> \u00a0This feature isn&#8217;t advertised heavily, but if you purchase the custom &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HX9AJ5M/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\">Sony Digital Noise Cancelling Headset (MDR-NC31EM)</a>&#8221; earbuds\u00a0for $45 and stick them in the phone, the Z3v will 1. recognize they are in, and 2. enable active noise-cancelling. \u00a0This works\u00a0because the earbuds have little microphones on them that sample the environment, which the phone then generates the inverse waveform for in certain bands and mixes that into the output. \u00a0While the earbuds aren&#8217;t the most comfortable things to have in for more than an hour, the features <strong>does work well</strong> &#8212; better than noise-isolation earbuds which I&#8217;ve used for a decade &#8212; and I&#8217;m thankful to have them on my commute. \u00a0I haven&#8217;t noticed any distortion, but I listen to mostly spoken material on my commute.</p>\n<p><strong>Wireless charging.</strong> \u00a0With <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JA7HNZO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\">a cheap Qi charger</a>, this simply <em>works</em>, which is great because the USB/charging port is normally behind a waterproof door you have to keep opening and closing when\u00a0connecting via that port.</p>\n<p><strong>Battery life.</strong> \u00a0The battery life on this phone is simply amazing given what the phone is capable of. \u00a0I can go two days on a single charge, and that includes 3-4 hours of screen-on time per day. \u00a0If that&#8217;s not good enough for you, there are two classes of power-saving modes with multiple levels of customization, the latter of which shuts down everything except calling and texting and can stretch a single charge up to\u00a0<strong>seven days</strong>. \u00a0Geezus.</p>\n<p>Sounds too good to be true? \u00a0Well&#8230;</p>\n<h1>Cons</h1>\n<p><strong>The 20MP mode is disappointing.</strong> \u00a0The camera normally shoots everything at\u00a08MP. \u00a0If you want the true resolution of the sensor, you can enable 20MP in &#8220;manual mode&#8221;. \u00a0It works, and you have some customization over the shot, but it&#8217;s disappointing because the sensor and lens are small enough that there is no appreciable extra detail captured in the 20MP shot. \u00a0I&#8217;ve done comparisons with the phone on a tripod in a lot of light and there was just no advantage: I scaled the 20MP shot down to 8MP in photoshop and it didn&#8217;t look any better; I did a 100% crop of a few locations in both images and the 20MP didn&#8217;t have any more detail, mostly just fuzzier larger sections. \u00a0So, it&#8217;s sort-of useless, and I don&#8217;t use it.</p>\n<p><strong>The phone is slippery.</strong> \u00a0The front and back are glass, and the edges are a rougher plastic material. \u00a0The\u00a0edges aren&#8217;t enough for me to keep a good grip on the phone at all times.</p>\n<p><strong>The native camera apps offer little customization.</strong> \u00a0If you want to shoot video under odd circumstances, or use the camera on a tripod to take nice stills, the native camera app &#8212; even in <strong>manual</strong> mode &#8212; \u00a0lacks a few things that make it difficult. \u00a0There&#8217;s no true manual focus or manual white balance. \u00a0You can pick focus &#8220;types&#8221; and white balance &#8220;types&#8221; but the focus and exposure are always auto-adjusting. \u00a0And the 4K video mode offers no customization whatsoever; it&#8217;s 100% auto-adjust.</p>\n<p><strong>60p isn&#8217;t really 60p. \u00a0</strong>For some inexplicable reason, the camera shoots video slightly slower than 59.94 or 60fps which are the only framerates considered 60p broadcast standard. \u00a0Out of several tests, the resulting videos had\u00a0<strong>variable framerates</strong>, <em><strong>all nonstandard,</strong></em> like 59.32 and 58.86. \u00a0This leads to slightly jerky video over longer lengths of time, and can cause issues editing in post. \u00a0<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFZDXuTtu24\">One video I shot and uploaded directly to YouTube</a> without editing shows up as &#8220;1080p59&#8221;. \u00a0(The\u00a030p video modes were all 29.97 like they&#8217;re supposed to be, so that&#8217;s good at least.)</p>\n<p><strong>4k video mode overheats the phone.</strong> \u00a0Seriously. \u00a0The first time you use it, you&#8217;ll get a pop-up saying that if the camera overheats, your video will be stopped, saved, and then the camera will shut down to cool off. \u00a0Sure enough, it does all that after about 5-7 minutes of 4K video shooting. \u00a0This, coupled with the 60p framerate issue noted above, seems very bubblegum-and-shoestring to me. \u00a0But, good luck getting those fixed, because:</p>\n<p><strong>Frankenphone = orphan.</strong> \u00a0The Z3v was the result of a partnership between Verizon and Sony; it is a hybrid of the Z2 and Z3. \u00a0As a result, neither company will fully support the phone. \u00a0I&#8217;ve tried to report the firmware bugs noted above to both companies, and both companies tell me to contact the other company. \u00a0Sony tells me that Verizon supports the phone exclusively, and Verizon tells me that any firmware bugs in the camera are the responsibility of the manufacturer. \u00a0Which really sucks, because:</p>\n<p><strong>Playing with the alarm volume can lock up the phone. \u00a0</strong>If you adjust the volume of an individual alarm a few times, then this hilarious thing happens: When the alarm time comes, it does not make noise but instead locks up the phone. \u00a0You have to mash and/or hold down the power button to get out of this state until the phone eventually reboots. \u00a0I was late to work one day\u00a0because of this. \u00a0It would be nice to be able to report this bug to someone, but oh well.</p>\n<p><strong>The front-facing speakers aren&#8217;t as loud or clear as they could be. \u00a0</strong>My son used to have an HTC One M7 and his audio was louder and clearer than on the Z2v despite the hardware\u00a0being almost 2 years older. \u00a0It&#8217;s not bad; just don&#8217;t assume it&#8217;s a replacement for good headphones.</p>\n<p><strong>The Stock youtube app doesn&#8217;t allow pre-downloading. \u00a0</strong>This feature was removed by YouTube at some point, angering hundreds of thousands of commuters, myself included. \u00a0I used the stock YouTube app on my Galaxy S4 for a full year for this reason so I could predownload videos in my &#8220;Watch Later&#8221; list\u00a0to view\u00a0on the train, and the Z3v app is fully updated\u00a0and doesn&#8217;t allow caching of videos.</p>\n<p>These were initially very big disappointments and I almost returned the phone because of them. \u00a0After some research, here&#8217;s how I mitigated them:</p>\n<h1>Workarounds</h1>\n<p><strong>Slippery</strong>: The Verizon store had a $20 cheap flexible plastic case that I put on it just to make it less slippery until I found something else. \u00a0I haven&#8217;t found anything else, so it&#8217;s still on there. \u00a0I tried\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OSDO92A/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\">carbon fiber stickers</a>;

column. \u00a0If you are only watching Monsters because you were a fan of Tales from the Darkside, there is a column for that too: Because both shows were created by the same production company and most of the same people, many Monsters episodes feel more like TFTD, so you can filter on that if you were only a fan of the former.</p>\n<p>But if you&#8217;re really short on time, just use the filter on the Grade column and watch anything graded A. \u00a0Some of those\u00a0are just\u00a0<em>bananas</em>.</p><br />Filed under: <a href='https://trixter.oldskool.org/category/entertainment/'>Entertainment</a>  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/trixter.wordpress.com/1196/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/trixter.wordpress.com/1196/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=trixter.oldskool.org&#038;blog=23286&#038;post=1196&#038;subd=trixter&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://trixter.oldskool.org/2014/10/11/an-episode-guide-to-monsters-the-tv-show/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/95363aee12ad9bff5db2c4425b22b313?s=96&#38;d=retro&#38;r=PG\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Trixter</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>The Outlandish Adventure of Miss Amanda Collins</title>\n\t\t<link>https://trixter.oldskool.org/2014/10/07/the-outlandish-adventure-of-miss-amanda-collins/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://trixter.oldskool.org/2014/10/07/the-outlandish-adventure-of-miss-amanda-collins/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2014 06:37:55 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Trixter]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Vintage Computing]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://trixter.oldskool.org/?p=1188</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[In the world of vintage computing history and preservation, I am both an archivist and a conservator. \u00a0There are very many archivists in various corners of our field;

it is easy to gather up collections from multiple sources and dump them in a single place for the viewing public. \u00a0Conservators, however, are the people who roll up their sleeves and get their hands dirty. \u00a0They perform the task\u00a0of extracting\u00a0the archival works in the first place from the original distribution medium. \u00a0This can range from reading files off of a disk, to\u00a0reconstructing long-past systems using 3-D printed replacement parts, to\u00a0figuring out the structure of unfamiliar data. \u00a0Conservation is work. \u00a0Our hobby needs more conservators.</p>\n<p>Some data rescues have high visibility, such as\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/04/an-amazing-discovery-andy-warhols-seminal-computer-art/\">the recovery of Andy Warhol&#8217;s early\u00a0digital art</a>. \u00a0But the majority of rescues\u00a0are not notable. \u00a0My\u00a0specific area of focus is very early (think 1980s) PC games on floppy disks, and recently I&#8217;ve recovered a few items not yet found &#8220;in the wild&#8221;, but painfully boring: \u00a0A horrible WWII flight combat\u00a0sim, a chess tutor, a children&#8217;s A-B-C program. \u00a0The latter is PCjr-specific, which is\u00a0intriguing, but for the most part these items hold no significant place in history. \u00a0Still, I do it for <em>The Cause</em>.</p>\n<p>One enjoyable side benefit of this work is occasionally coming across something human\u00a0amongst the digital clutter. \u00a0Like\u00a0a trunk discovered in an\u00a0attic that hasn&#8217;t been opened in decades, you can find all sorts of clues about a person&#8217;s or family&#8217;s past, pieces of their lives, hiding in the data: Letters to family, ledgers and receipts, creative writing, favorite recipes, comic book collections, a child&#8217;s digital fingerpainting. \u00a0I&#8217;ve found these and more during my archaeology, and it always makes me smile. \u00a0(Please don&#8217;t get the wrong idea; I don&#8217;t mean the above to sound voyeuristic, but rather more of admiration and respect for the original owners who actually used their systems to improve their lives.)</p>\n<p>One favorite example in recent memory was when I rescued\u00a0a no-name taiwanese XT clone out of the trash (literally; it was in a dumpster). \u00a0Based on the files left behind, the system\u00a0was owned by an asian female college student in the late 1980s who was an accounting major and used the computer exclusively for school&#8230; or so it looked at first glance. \u00a0Tucked away among all of the spreadsheets, essays, and databases, in a tiny corner of the filesystem, was a single directory that was filled with poetry, in a style written with few carefully and powerfully chosen words. \u00a0The entire system and its files gave the impression of a young woman who was following her father&#8217;s wishes, but who longed for something more fulfilling.</p>\n<p>And it is here I will introduce you to miss Amanda Collins, who holds the record for the most endearing recovery I&#8217;ve had this decade. \u00a0I don&#8217;t know anything about her other than her name, and I certainly don&#8217;t know which\u00a0out of the nearly 1500 &#8220;Amanda Collins&#8221; located in the USA White Pages she is. \u00a0I don&#8217;t know how old she is, although I have a good guess how old she was All I can tell you is how I found her.</p>\n<p>I was going through disks to archive and found a commercial business program from the early 1980s\u00a0that looked interesting; I had never run across it before, and it was copy-protected which is always a fun challenge. \u00a0But more interesting is that it was <em>sticky</em>. \u00a0As in, <strong>peanut butter and jelly</strong> sticky &#8212; on the media itself (ie. the part that shows in the &#8220;window&#8221; that the diskette sleeve&#8217;s pictographs illustrated\u00a0you were\u00a0never, ever supposed to touch). \u00a0Rescuing this disk required actual warm water, a soft cloth, and careful rubbing. \u00a0Unfortunately, the diskette had been permanently damaged by whatever had stuck\u00a0to\u00a0the media, but I figured I&#8217;d work a little harder on the first few tracks just so I could see what was on the disk and call it a day. \u00a0At the end of the directory, after the commercial program files, was a file called <strong>ET</strong> with no date on it. \u00a0I wasn&#8217;t able to rescue the program, but I was able to get the <strong>ET</strong> file. \u00a0It is my pleasure to share it with you\u00a0exactly as I found it:</p>\n<pre>ONE DAY I WAS WALKING DOWN THE STRET \r\nAND SAW E.T.

are touched upon. \u00a0Inevitable comparisons with Akira are made.</p>\n<h2>Here Be Dragons</h2>\n<p>While the producer and director did an admirable\u00a0job making the source material interesting and presentable to the public,\u00a0there are a <strong>lot</strong> of flaws with the documentary. \u00a0Some are minor and can be overlooked, such as the 1990s trend of inserting\u00a0faux computer graphic overlays (to try to make the material more similar to the world Gibson painted in Neuromancer). \u00a0Many of the problems are with pacing; there are entire sections that focus on a particular subject for too long, sometimes without impact. \u00a0One section in particular goes so long that different digital effects\u00a0start to fade in and out after a few minutes, almost as if the editor was bored and resorted to doing something with the image to keep the viewer&#8217;s interest.</p>\n<p>There are also some <em>very </em>misrepresented facts and predictions, but it&#8217;s not really fair to criticize a documentary for failing to predict the future correctly. \u00a0That being said, there are some real howlers in here, from the supposed power hackers wield(ed) against governments, to the silly, amateur computer graphics that obscure hackers&#8217; identities, to the heavily hinted-at\u00a0concept that Neuromancer itself was responsible for shaping technology and history. \u00a0The most egregious is equating <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_(hobbyist)\">hacker</a> with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_(computer_security)\">cracker</a>\u00a0(although, to be fair, that&#8217;s happened multiple times before and since).</p>\n<p>A special mention must be given to Michael Synergy, who perfectly embodies the huckster who started believing his own bullshit. \u00a0Some of his claims in the documentary are so utterly, patently ridiculous, so incredibly pretentious, that it takes a great deal of willpower not to scream at him\u00a0when he&#8217;s talking (especially when he mispronounces the word &#8220;genre&#8221;). \u00a0Were I him, I would have wanted this stage in my life to disappear, and it seems as if that wish has come true: His moniker disappeared with the 1990s. \u00a0My personal wild speculation\u00a0is that once the real, actual revolution of the web occurred and it was able to finally call him out, he quietly exited stage left. \u00a0(Last I heard, he worked for\u00a0Autodesk in the mid-1990s, was going by his birth\u00a0name again, living in Hawaii, working in IT; if anyone has a real update, I would love to know what actually happened to him.)</p>\n<p>Most depressingly, there is a real missed opportunity with how\u00a0Jaron Lanier&#8217;s involvement was portrayed. \u00a0In the documentary, he comes across as a stoner who only mentions VR, which is a shame because &#8212; then and now &#8212; he&#8217;s the most relevant and accurate\u00a0representation of a hacker that the documentary includes. \u00a0Of everybody interviewed, Jaron is the only person who is still exploring these concepts and ideas, and more importantly their unintended fallout, which you can read about in his most recent book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Who-Owns-Future-Jaron-Lanier/dp/1451654960\">Who Owns The Future?</a>. \u00a0(Even if you don&#8217;t buy the book, follow that link and read the Q&amp;A to get a feeling for his concerns.)</p>\n<h2>Worth watching?</h2>\n<p>While it may be hard to sit through, the documentary retains glimpses of the innocent, wildly-optimistic, techno-hippie idealism that grew with the rise of personal computing and networking. \u00a0For that nostalgia factor alone &#8212; the time when the Internet existed but the World-Wide Web did not &#8212; it&#8217;s worth an hour of your time. \u00a0It&#8217;s also worth watching to catch which ideas were especially prescient, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Whoever holds the most information holds the most power</li>\n<li>Every device will be interconnected</li>\n<li>Physical boundaries will not impede meaningful communication</li>\n<li>People will be individual, mobile, uncensored\u00a0&#8220;broadcast stations&#8221; (considering I can post to youtube from my phone, I&#8217;d call this\u00a0a reality)</li>\n<li>The &#8220;matrix&#8221; as a concept and/or allegory for God (later realized almost to the letter in The Matrix movie trilogy)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8230;and so on. \u00a0You could make an interesting drinking game out of catching which ideas succeeded (although you&#8217;d get more drunk, quickly, by catching all of the stupid and inaccurate comments).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/cyberpunk_201410\">Cyberpunk: The Documentary</a> is now available at archive.org. \u00a0Grab the MPEG-TS file if able;

To everyone who dropped me a note via twitter, email, or youtube &#8212; and there were thousands of you &#8212; I want to thank you for the kind and encouraging words.</p>\n<p>Even before I finished the design, I knew that I was going to release all of the source, so that others could make their own videos for their own vintage systems. I was careful to design the system to be easy to understand, so that it could be easy to port to other languages or extend with new features. I have a lot of comments in the code, some fairly verbose, so that there is no confusion why something is designed a particular way, or why one operation happens before another. I want this to be representative of the quality of code I usually write.</p>\n<p>So, why am I overdue in releasing the code? Bugs! Or, more accurately, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_case\">edge cases</a>. To ensure that the encoder works properly in the real world, I&#8217;ve been testing it with vastly different sources: Animations, music videos, cartoons, even a full-length movie. And almost every time, I encounter a new edge case that needs fixing. Oh, don&#8217;t worry &#8212; The code isn&#8217;t full of special cases or bubblegum-and-shoestring workarounds. It just takes time to address each issue that crops up, and determine if it&#8217;s a true bug that needs fixing, or an issue that can be safely ignored.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Ignore issues in code? Impossabru!&#8221; Actually, here&#8217;s an example of what I mean: I discovered\u00a0a few weeks ago that I could improve the efficiency of the output a few percent by re-running some optimization phases before final compilation. However, doing this will sometimes create a small &#8220;empty&#8221; 1-byte delta that actually isn&#8217;t a delta (ie. the locations contains the same data in the previous and next video frames). It&#8217;s a bug, but is it worth fixing? I could spend days rewriting the optimization phase into a gigantic, monolithic procedure where all parts coordinate&#8230; or, I can throw these 1-byte non-changes away at the end of the existing optimization phase. You can guess which path I chose.</p>\n<p>Some bugs are indeed bugs, and they must be fixed before I put my name on the code. For example, the bug that forced the encoding loop into a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock\">deadlock</a>, or the bug that randomly produces black flashes in the output (still working on this one), or the bug whose generated code forgot to set a single register which prevented videos from being played without a soundcard present.</p>\n<p>So, I hope everyone understands why the code release is late. Well&#8230; one of the reasons it is late. The other reason is that making your own videos will require some documentation (some user-directed preprocessing of the source video is necessary &#8212; sorry!), and a video showing the steps involved couldn&#8217;t hurt either, so that will require a few days by itself.</p>\n<p>While you&#8217;re waiting, why not help me decide what movie to convert and release with the final distribution? In keeping with the spirit of the time period, I&#8217;m going to convert an entire full-length movie using the system, and ensure that it will fit onto a single CD-ROM so that users without <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/xtideuniversalbios/\">homebrew XTIDE controllers</a> can hook up a SCSI CDROM drive and enjoy the flick (ironically). The defacto example\u00a0for this kind of thing is Star Wars, although I&#8217;m partial to TRON, as it was released after the IBM PC itself was and has its own share of iconic sequences. But, I&#8217;ve already done TRON to death, so what would you like to see?

I reuse some terminology introduced in the first part, so before we continue, it&#8217;s worth reviewing some key definitions to avoid confusion:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><strong>Delta</strong>: An area of bytes that needs to change in screen memory to update the displayed image<br />\n<strong>Slice</strong>: A delta where not all bytes are the same value<br />\n<strong>Run</strong>: A delta where all bytes <em>are</em> the same value</p>\n<p>On to the nitty-gritty!</p>\n<h1>Breaking With Tradition</h1>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve coded video or animation systems in the past, you may have correctly identified what I&#8217;m doing as less of a video codec and more of an animation system. Animation systems from the 1980s such as <a href=\"http://bustingseams.blogspot.com/2009/05/autodesk-animator.html\">Autodesk Animator</a> or <a href=\"http://theindiestone.com/binky/2011/03/09/why-i-still-love-deluxe-paint-animation/\">DeluxePaint Animation</a> store and play back deltas by iterating through data that describe what areas of screen memory to change, using codes and chunk types for things like &#8220;skip N pixels forward, then change M pixels&#8221;, &#8220;fill entire screen to solid color N&#8221;, and so on. This reduces the size of the file, but requires some decision-making and branching while iterating through the data.</p>\n<p>I initially did the same thing, and wrote a fast routine that would iterate through a list of deltas to replay, handling runs using the efficient REP STOSB sequence, and the rest with REP MOVSB. It looked something like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\">\r\nDelta format:\r\n0-1: start offset\r\n2:   length in upper 7 bits and run/slice in LSB. If set, is run.\r\n3:   fill value (if run; unused if slice)\r\n4-N: data (if slice)\r\n\r\nDecompressed via:\r\n; Prior setup:\r\n; DS:SI=source data\r\n; ES = destination (screen RAM)\r\n; DX = number of deltas to iterate through\r\n\r\n@loopit:\r\n    lodsw       ;load offset\r\n    xchg di,ax  ;get destination ready\r\n    lodsw       ;load bit, length, value\r\n    shr ah,1    ;isolate LSB?\r\n    mov cl,ah   ;move length into place\r\n    jc @run     ;if so, it's a run\r\n                ;runs are the exception; slices should fall though first\r\n@slice:\r\n    rep movsb   ;copy slice to screen\r\n    ;okay to fall through here since cx=0, rep stosb will do nothing\r\n@run:\r\n    rep stosb   ;replay run to screen (AL already has value)\r\n@continue:\r\n    dec dx\r\n    jnz @loopit\r\n</pre>\n<p>This is optimal 8088 code for this operation, but the idea has two problems. First is a minor annoyance; a byte is wasted storing a fill value even if we aren&#8217;t handling a run. But the real problem is that there are two branches (JC and JNZ) for every delta we iterate over in the list. Branches are costly on almost all CPUs, even those as old as the 8088. This was a huge concern for me, as the average new image in my test material was made up of roughly 600 deltas, most of them slices. Some quick math to illustrate why this concerned me:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"># of cycles available to us to paint a frame: About 40,000<br />\n# of cycles taken up by one untaken (JC) and one taken (JNZ) branch: About 24<br />\n# of cycles used by branches to replay 600 deltas: 14,400 (36% of our total)</p>\n<p>So, in a typical frame full of changes, <strong>more than a third of our available CPU time is wasted handling branches</strong>. In a system where we have the same time quantum as 8088 Corruption but are trying to change <em>more</em> data than it did, this was a big step in the wrong direction!</p>\n<p>I thought of a few ways to mitigate this cost, such as unrolling the loop, rearranging deltas so that slices and runs are grouped together, and so on. This went on for about an hour before inspiration struck: Why not eliminate the branches altogether?</p>\n<p>And just how the hell do you do that? <strong>By generating code instead of data.</strong> Instead of having the encoder spit out a description of what changes need to be made each frame, we switch to generating x86 <em>opcodes</em> that, when executed, <em>directly implement the changes themselves</em>.</p>\n<p>This is the same strategy used to <a href=\"http://www.nondot.org/sabre/graphpro/sprite4.html\">accelerate sprite plotting</a> on many architectures, but when I realized I&#8217;d be doing the same thing for the entire screen, I started laughing out loud. What a ludicrous idea! And yet, in practice, you can see that it works.</p>\n<h1>It&#8217;s A Compiler!</h1>\n<p>The basic structure of a video &#8220;code&#8221; frame looks like this:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><strong>Startup code</strong>: Sets ES to point to the screen and DS:SI to point somewhere below its own instruction stream to where the data stream starts<br />\n<strong>Instruction stream</strong>: Instructions that re-point DI to new screen memory destinations and then issue combinations of MOV, MOVSB, STOSB, REP MOVSB, or REP STOSB to change screen memory contents<br />\n<strong>Cleanup code</strong>: A single RETF instruction to return to the caller<br />\n<strong>Data stream</strong>: For (REP) MOVSB, data that gets moved to areas of screen memory</p>\n<p>As long as the code is aligned to a DOS 16-bit paragraph boundary, it will execute properly, so the player code enforces alignment of the frame data to paragraph boundaries. Not doing so results in hilarity, as the correct screen memory locations will be changed properly, but with data from the wrong place:</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_1095\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://trixter.oldskool.org/2014/06/20/8088-domination-post-mortem-conclusion/xdc_play_000/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1095\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1095\" src=\"https://trixter.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/xdc_play_000.png?w=640&#038;h=400\" alt=\"This is supposed to be an anime girl, not digital vomit\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">This is supposed to be an anime girl, not digital vomit</p></div>\n<p>(It is, of course, quite possible to rewrite a few values in the code to get it to execute properly wherever it is located, but I didn&#8217;t want to perform code fixups realtime at 60hz &#8212; the system is already slow, let&#8217;s not make it any slower.)</p>\n<p>Because the instruction stream adds size and processing time to the video data, it&#8217;s important for us to generate optimal code that is as fast as possible without being too large. For example, if you want to set a single byte in an arbitrary location pointed to by ES:, most x86 asm programmers would do it like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\">ES: MOV BYTE PTR [nnnn],val</pre>\n<p>This is fast and is 5 bytes in size. But if you have your value pointed to by DS:SI, you can also do it like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\">MOV DI,nnnn\r\nMOVSB</pre>\n<p>This is also 5 bytes (4 opcode, 1 data) but is slightly slower&#8230; but because MOVSB advances DI automatically, it can save you from having to do the same thing manually. For a single byte it&#8217;s not a win, but what if we have three bytes to change? We can continue to set them directly:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\">ES: MOV WORD PTR [nnnn],mmmm\r\nES: MOV BYTE PTR [nnnn],mm</pre>\n<p>&#8230;or do this instead:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\">MOV DI,nnnn\r\nMOVSW\r\nMOVSB</pre>\n<p>The latter method is much smaller and slightly faster. (This can go on for a while, but eventually there is a break-even point where switching to REP MOVSB is faster than all other encodings.)</p>\n<p>Although I had worked out most optimal combinations for various slice and run durations, in the end I felt it was better to just have the compiler generate <strong>every</strong> code variation, calculate how many cycles each one took to execute, and pick the fastest one. (I figured it was safer and more future-proof than me trying to hand-optimize generator output.) Calculating cycle counts for the 8088 is almost as easy as it is for 8-bit CPUs; the 8088 has only one core, no cache, no threads, no pipelines, no out-of-order execution&#8230; it does have a prefetch queue, but it is only 4 bytes long so it isn&#8217;t very effective. The major factor in optimizing 8088 code for speed is minimizing memory accesses, because the CPU takes 4 cycles to read (or write) a byte &#8212; any byte, even instruction stream opcodes. So, in most cases, the smallest code usually wins. The only exceptions to this rule are instructions that take an extremely long time, such as MUL/DIV, which can run for over 100 cycles depending on the operands.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.reenigne.org/blog/\">Andrew Jenner</a>, a good friend and a better coder than I am, has an excellent rule of thumb for determining 8088 code execution speed: Multiply the size of the opcode <strong>and </strong>the size of any data touched by that opcode by 4 for an informal cycle count; then, also determine the sum of <a href=\"http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~mckeeman/cs48/mxcom/doc/x86.html\">each instruction&#8217;s published cycle count</a>. Whichever number is <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">larger</span> is the more accurate execution time estimate.</p>\n<p>I won&#8217;t go over the code generator itself in this write-up because it is very mundane and not terribly exciting; refer to the source code when I release it in a few weeks.</p>\n<h1>Delta Optimizations</h1>\n<p>Once I had an idea of the code generation cost, I came up with a couple of ways to reduce that cost by manipulating the delta list before it was processed by the encoder. Less work for the compiler to do meant smaller code/data and faster execution. Delta optimization consists of four phases:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Run Identification and Splitting</strong>. Because runs process faster and encode much smaller than slices, it is a huge win to identify any runs hiding inside of slices and split them out into their own delta. This phase also marks any runs it finds as excluded from further processing (&#8220;frozen&#8221;), as runs are already optimal.</li>\n<li><strong>Pixel &#8220;Shaving&#8221;</strong>. Changing only a single byte in screen memory has a very high cost (5 opcode bytes, plus the time they take to execute) so pixel &#8220;shaving&#8221; looks at each single-byte delta to determine how many pixels are actually changed by the byte. If a particular threshold is not met (ie. &#8220;more than one pixel&#8221;), the delta is dropped completely. This is a user-configurable option and is off by default.</li>\n<li><strong>Delta &#8220;Shaving&#8221;</strong>. Identical to pixel shaving, except entire deltas are dropped if they aren&#8217;t large enough. The default threshold is &#8220;more than two bytes&#8221;; anything smaller is dropped. This is also user-configurable, and also off by default.</li>\n<li><strong>Delta Combination</strong>. This phase looks for deltas that are spatially close to each other in linear memory and combines them together if the end result would encode as less bytes. For example, assume we have three 1-byte deltas all spaced one byte apart. Also assume that replaying these three deltas costs 5 bytes each, for a total of 15. Now consider what happens if we combine all three deltas into a single delta spanning the three changed bytes: The number of bytes changed onscreen will grow by 2, but we shed\u00a010 bytes because we only have one delta to set up and replay. It is a net win, so it is always worth it to try to find combination opportunities. (This is technically an NP-hard problem, and implementing it quickly and stupidly as an exhaustive search greatly slowed down the code. I optimized it by re-sorting the deltas by start offset, so that the search space is localized around the delta(s) being examined. After all the combinations are found, the deltas are re-sorted back into the order that assists the encoding phase, as described earlier in part 1.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All of these phases reduce size and execution cost. The pixel shaving and delta shaving phases have the added benefit of cleaning up the source video a little; if a pixel is &#8220;shimmering&#8221; over time due to being right at the error threshold of the dithering process, it will be &#8220;stable&#8221; with pixel or delta shaving turned on. The drawback to the shaving phases, however, is that the output can leave &#8220;trails&#8221; onscreen as smaller changes are never fully cleaned up or overwritten. Use with caution.</p>\n<p>(While not benefiting optimization, there is also a prep phase that executes before the other phases and performs oversize delta splitting, which takes deltas that are too large to execute within our available cycle pool and breaks them up into smaller deltas. This is always necessary when the entire screen changes, as this creates a delta list that consists of only one single delta with a start offset of zero\u00a0and an end offset at the edge of screen memory. A delta that big\u00a0is way over both the available byte and cycle limits, so it has to be split into smaller chunks to be replayed over multiple passes.)</p>\n<h1>Playing With Variable Packets</h1>\n<p>The player for the 8088 Domination FMV data is very similar to 8088 Corruption: By controlling the size of the audio data the soundcard interrupt handles, we can get the interrupt to fire at our desired video framerate and use the opportunity to update the video as well. The interrupt handler pulls data out of a queue and updates the screen at the same time it updates the audio. While the interrupt is firing in the background, a foreground loop is constantly reading from disk and putting data into a queue. I cover this in more detail in <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/8088CorruptionExplained\">8088 Corruption Explained</a>, so if you have a half hour to kill, I highly recommend <a href=\"https://archive.org/download/8088CorruptionExplained/8088CorruptionExplained_NTSC_DVD.mpg\">snagging the MPEG-2 file</a> (best quality) and watching it.</p>\n<p>Where the players differ, however is in two areas:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Instead of moving video data to screen RAM, the Domination player CALLs the video frame code, which executes and then returns</li>\n<li>The read-and-fill-memory loop, as well as the interrupt handler pointer management code, deals with variably-sized video+audio packets; this is because the output of the encoder varies in size based on how many changes are present from frame to frame</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Two changes were made to the muxed video+audio stream for Domination that not only enabled handling variably-sized packets, but also sped up disk reads. The first change was to align each packet of video+audio data to disk sector boundaries, which sped up disk reads due to the way DOS handles buffering: DOS will normally transfer disk requests into its own internal buffers (if you&#8217;ve ever wondered what the BUFFERS= line in CONFIG.SYS was for, now you know) and then copy to the caller&#8217;s buffer. However, if the caller requests reading a sector-aligned offset (and amount) into a normalized paragraph-aligned pointer, DOS is smart enough to instruct the BIOS to transfer the data directly to the caller&#8217;s buffer. This made disk reads return a little quicker, as DOS&#8217;s usual double-buffering step was avoided.</p>\n<p>The second change to the player was to keep track of how large each video+audio packet was. Rather than put size headers before each chunk, or scan the entire file before starting to determine sizes, I chose to write an index to the end of the file stream. The index consists of one byte per video+audio packet, where each byte indicates the size of the packet in sectors; this is possible because each packet is guaranteed to be aligned to sectors. (This limits the size of each packet to (255*512) = 127.5KB, but we will never see a single frame that large in practice; in fact, we will never see a packet larger than 64KB because that is the 16-bit real-mode segment size limit.)</p>\n<p>The most amount of time I spent enhancing the player for the Domination format was, to my surprise, the memory handling. The original player used a circular buffer (a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO\">FIFO</a> queue) that fed disk data into the &#8220;head&#8221; while the interrupt handler grabbed\u00a0data from the &#8220;tail&#8221;. Typical circular buffers are divided into fixed-size blocks, but I had just switched to variably-sized packets. I needed a FIFO that could:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Accept variably-sized allocations/deallocations</li>\n<li>Manage a linear area of memory with wraparound without requiring that area to be a power-of-two length</li>\n<li>Be interrupt-safe (ie. no locks/mutexes/semaphores required to put data in or pull data out)</li>\n<li>Always return paragraph-aligned normalized pointers</li>\n<li>Perform all of the above while dealing with 16-bit real-mode segment limitations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the end, I wrote code that was not so much a typical circular buffer, but more of a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(programming)#Dynamic_memory_allocation\">heap manager</a> where the caller &#8220;reserves&#8221; an amount of memory, receives a pointer to an area they can use, fills it with data, and then &#8220;commits&#8221; the area. Prior commits can be retrieved in FIFO order using another function. The design is interrupt-safe because reserves and commits don&#8217;t touch the data structures that are used by retrievals, and vice versa. I know it sounds stupid to be proud of a data structure, but I was pretty pleased with myself when I finished implementing it. (I&#8217;ve since learned there is a similar construct out there called a <a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/3479/The-Bip-Buffer-The-Circular-Buffer-with-a-Twist\">bip buffer</a>, but a bip buffer wastes more memory and time than what I came up with.)</p>\n<h1>In Search Of Test Material</h1>\n<p>With two fully-functioning video modes supported by the encoder, I now had to choose some test material to show it off. For the color portion, I decided to use exactly the same footage that I&#8217;d used 10 years earlier with Corruption, so that people could directly compare them and see for themselves that the newer method was better overall. For the B&amp;W portion, I had difficulty picking material; I was about to go with one of the old <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQw3mVWXncg\">Apple silhouette-style ipod/itunes commercials</a> until I saw <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v37n8r-wQeU\">a Game Sack episode</a> where a homebrew Genesis cart was shown playing <a href=\"http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/bad-apple\">the Bad Apple animation</a>. I was hooked &#8212; it was perfect test material. High-contrast shadow puppetry lent itself very well to my &#8220;animation compiler&#8221; because, most of the time, very little is actually changing per frame, and what <em>is</em> changing has very clean residuals.</p>\n<p>Finding a clean source of the Bad Apple animation proved more difficult than I thought it would be. Every youtube version had resizing or transcoding artifacts, so after some research I found the original japanese video-sharing site it originated from and grabbed it from there, which resulted in an extremely clean 30fps source to work with.</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>8088 Domination may be my best work; I&#8217;m very proud of the result. I had to think creatively and unconventionally to solve problems. If people are considered artists based on the uniqueness and viewpoint of their output &#8212; paintings, novels, musical works &#8212; then I&#8217;d like to think <a href=\"http://chrishecker.com/Can_a_Computer_Make_You_Cry%3F\">programmers can be artists too</a>, and judged by the same conventions.</p>\n<p>I want to fix a few bugs in the source and tidy it up, and once I&#8217;ve done that I will release the source, executables, and documentation so that you can create your own videos using the system. Until then, enjoy a video of the competition I showed it at, complete with audience reaction:</p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390'

Before reading further, it might be worthwhile to familiarize yourself with the production itself if you haven&#8217;t seen it. Here is video of what it looks like running on a 1981 IBM PC 5150 connected to a TV via the composite output jack:</p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/MWdG413nNkI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<p>&#8230;and if you doubt the above video&#8217;s authenticity, you can <a href=\"https://www.scene.org/file.php?file=%2Fparties%2F2014%2Fatparty14%2Fdemo_oldschool%2F8088_domination_party_version.zip&amp;fileinfo\">download the production</a> and run it on your own vintage hardware as proof.</p>\n<p>I would like to apologize in advance for switching between past tense (ie. my thought process during the design phase) and present tense (when describing how to achieve certain objectives) throughout this write-up.</p>\n<h1>Background</h1>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been fascinated by desktop digital video for decades. Starting with the first Video For Windows tools in the early 1990s, using early capture hardware (like the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Vision#PC_adapter_cards\">Media Vision Pro Movie Spectrum</a>, which captured directly into <a href=\"http://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php?title=Microsoft_Video_1\">MSV1/CRAM format</a>), I&#8217;ve toyed with desktop video and its possibilities.</p>\n<p>Of course, I&#8217;ve also been fascinated with demos since the early 1990s, and when you love two things that much, you find ways to mash them together. Many of my demoscene productions have had video as a part or whole of them in some way. <a href=\"http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=17201\">Grind</a> (1993) was a modplayer that displayed dancing Spring Break girls in perfect time to the music; the end-part of <a href=\"http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=2500\">Explicit</a> (1996) has dancing clubbers embedded in cubes, also dancing in perfect time to the music; and of course <a href=\"http://www.oldskool.org/pc/8088_Corruption\">8088 Corruption</a> (2004) which displayed FMV on a 1981 IBM PC and took a chunk out of my <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_minutes_of_fame\">15 minutes</a>.</p>\n<p>8088 Corruption was not recognized for amazing quality video, but rather its novel solution to the problem of trying to display FMV on such a limited platform. That solution was to use <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_Graphics_Adapter#Standard_text_modes\">40&#215;25 text mode</a>, since that was the only mode represented in an amount of video memory that could be completely changed every frame without distracting artifacts or overtaxing the system.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6CkYou6hYU\">I gave a talk in 2007</a> that explained 8088 Corruption in detail, and in that talk I explained that displaying FMV using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_Graphics_Adapter#Standard_graphics_modes\">CGA in graphics mode</a> would be impossible. This is because CGA graphics mode uses 8x the amount of video memory that 8088 Corruption was handling. Even a simple calculation assuming 24fps video reveals that the amount of data needing to be updated per second (24fps * 16KB = 384KB/s) is outside of the IBM PC&#8217;s capability: CGA RAM can only be changed at a rate of 240KB/s, and most hard drives of the era operate at roughly 90KB/s. It sure felt impossible, so that&#8217;s why I said it.</p>\n<p>Then I thought about the problem for 7 years.</p>\n<h1>Adjusting Expectations</h1>\n<p>I came to several realizations over the past few years thinking about this &#8220;impossible&#8221; problem. The most basic realization is that it isn&#8217;t always necessary to change every single pixel on the screen to show convincing FMV. If only a portion of the frame is in motion, such as in traditional animation, or a &#8220;talking heads&#8221; newscast, not every pixel is changing onscreen. But even if all pixels in a frame are changing, they might only be changing just a little bit&#8230; and if they are changing that little, the viewer might not notice if we cheat and don&#8217;t change them at all. So, we need to let go of the idea that we must change the entire screen every frame. \u00a0<strong>With the right picture content, we can get away with changing only a portion of screen memory</strong>, and it will <em>look</em>\u00a0like we&#8217;re changing the entire screen.</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_1125\" style=\"width: 1083px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://trixter.oldskool.org/2014/06/19/8088-domination-post-mortem-part-1/delta_anim/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1125\"><img class=\"wp-image-1125 size-full\" src=\"https://trixter.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/delta_anim.gif?w=1073&#038;h=335\" alt=\"delta_anim\" width=\"1073\" height=\"335\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Left: Black and White=differences, Grey=unchanged. Right: What the user sees after applying only the changes</p></div>\n<p>Another realization was found re-evaluating what kind of bandwidth is available on the system. Previously, I was using the &#8220;40&#215;25 text mode 2K of RAM&#8221; definition as the limit of what can be changed onscreen. But &#8220;2K of data changed&#8221; isn&#8217;t the real limitation; rather, it&#8217;s &#8220;not exceeding the time it takes to alter 2K&#8221;. In other words, the real limitation is <strong>not exceeding a specific time quantum per frame updating screen memory</strong>, no matter how much screen memory you&#8217;re changing.</p>\n<p>This lead to a similar thought about disk I/O. In Corruption, I treated disk bandwidth as a series of fixed-length reads at a frequency of the framerate I needed to produce. As a result, Corruption uses fixed-length video+audio packets, so that (framerate * packetsize) is guaranteed to be less than the available disk bandwidth. But there&#8217;s no reason to adhere to that; the real limitation is the disk I/O itself, and <strong>I could read any amount of disk I wanted in a given time period as long as I didn&#8217;t exceed what the hardware could provide</strong>. This lead to the realization that video+audio packets could be of a variable length.</p>\n<p>The combination of these and other ideas led to the design of a system that could fulfill the original requirement of &#8220;FMV in graphics mode&#8221;, which means we need a system that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Finds differences between frames and updates screen memory with only those differences</li>\n<li>Keeps track of how much time it takes to change screen memory and doesn&#8217;t exceed it</li>\n<li>Keeps track of how much disk space is used and doesn&#8217;t exceed the transfer rates of the disk subsystem</li>\n<li>Most importantly, degrades gracefully if we run out of CPU time or disk bandwidth before the source image is finished displaying</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because the IBM PC is not fast enough to make these decisions realtime (nor has the bandwidth to do so), all of these constraints needed to be handled during the encoding phase, when we have nearly unlimited time. That also means that most (if not all) of these constraints are really just data management problems, which I&#8217;ll get to later. But before we write even a single line of code, we need to back up a little and see how to convert 24-bit color pictures into something that doesn&#8217;t look like total crap\u00a0on\u00a0a CGA card.</p>\n<h1>CGA FMV Graphics Conversion</h1>\n<p>A quick primer on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_Graphics_Adapter\">CGA</a>: CGA was the first color graphics standard for the IBM PC, and contains 16KB of memory to hold screen contents. That memory can be presented as a few different graphics modes that <em>appear</em> different, but are actually all the same under the hood: 80 &#8220;byte columns&#8221; wide by 200 lines. Those 80 byte-columns can be sliced up a few different ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>640&#215;200 with 2 colors (1 bit per pixel)</li>\n<li>320&#215;200 with 4 colors (2 bits per pixel)</li>\n<li>160&#215;200 with 16 colors (4 bits per pixel)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let&#8217;s see what those look like in practice. Here&#8217;s a pretty hummingbird:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://trixter.oldskool.org/2014/06/19/8088-domination-post-mortem-part-1/hum_original/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1131\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1131\" src=\"https://trixter.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/hum_original.png?w=640&#038;h=480\" alt=\"hum_original\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a></p>\n<p>&#8230;and here&#8217;s that hummingbird converted to our three basic choices without any fancy processing:</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_1132\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://trixter.oldskool.org/2014/06/19/8088-domination-post-mortem-part-1/hum_160_nodither/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1132\"><img class=\"wp-image-1132 size-full\" src=\"https://trixter.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/hum_160_nodither.png?w=640&#038;h=480\" alt=\"hum_160_nodither\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">160&#215;200, 16 colors</p></div>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_1133\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://trixter.oldskool.org/2014/06/19/8088-domination-post-mortem-part-1/hum_320_nodither/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1133\"><img class=\"wp-image-1133 size-full\" src=\"https://trixter.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/hum_320_nodither.png?w=640&#038;h=480\" alt=\"hum_320_nodither\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">320&#215;200, 4 colors, palette 1</p></div>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_1134\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://trixter.oldskool.org/2014/06/19/8088-domination-post-mortem-part-1/hum_640_nodither/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1134\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1134\" src=\"https://trixter.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/hum_640_nodither.png?w=640&#038;h=480\" alt=\"640x200, 2 colors\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">640&#215;200, 2 colors</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Already the graphics programmers in the audience are screaming <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither\">DITHER THAT SHIT</a>, and they would normally be correct. However, most dithers that people are familiar with are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_diffusion\">error-diffusing dithers</a>, which means that error differences are propagated throughout the entire picture. This is <em>not</em> a good idea for a system that is going to be recording changes between frames, because if a single pixel changes in the source material, every single pixel in the dither algorithm&#8217;s row scanning order after the change is going to change as well. What we need is a so-called <em>stable</em> or <em>localized</em> dither, where the value of each output pixel does not depend on its neighbors. That way, when only a local area of the source material changes, only that area of the destination dither will change as well.</p>\n<p>While there are some modified, alternate dithers that keep error propagation to a spatial minimum (ie. <a href=\"http://www.compuphase.com/riemer.htm\">Riemersma dither</a>, which dithers along a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve\">Hilbert curve</a>), the only truly localized dithering algorithm I know of is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_dithering\">ordered dithering</a>, sometimes called Bayer dithering. Some of the best publicly-available research on color ordered dithering is by Bisqwit (&#8220;<a href=\"http://bisqwit.iki.fi/story/howto/dither/jy/\">Yliluoma&#8217;s arbitrary-palette positional dithering algorithm</a>&#8220;) so I won&#8217;t try to explain the concepts here; consult that instead.</p>\n<p>Applying even a rudimentary ordered dither to our sources now shows this for our hummingbird converted to our three graphics modes:</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_1135\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://trixter.oldskool.org/2014/06/19/8088-domination-post-mortem-part-1/hum_160_dither/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1135\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1135\" src=\"https://trixter.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/hum_160_dither.png?w=640&#038;h=480\" alt=\"160x200, 16 colors, ordered dither\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">160&#215;200, 16 colors, ordered dither</p></div>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_1136\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://trixter.oldskool.org/2014/06/19/8088-domination-post-mortem-part-1/hum_320_dither/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1136\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1136\" src=\"https://trixter.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/hum_320_dither.png?w=640&#038;h=480\" alt=\"320x200, 4 colors, palette 1, ordered dither\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">320&#215;200, 4 colors, palette 1, ordered dither</p></div>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_1137\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://trixter.oldskool.org/2014/06/19/8088-domination-post-mortem-part-1/hum_640_dither/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1137\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1137\" src=\"https://trixter.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/hum_640_dither.png?w=640&#038;h=480\" alt=\"640x200, 2 colors, ordered dither\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">640&#215;200, 2 colors, ordered dither</p></div>\n<p>Much nicer, and we don&#8217;t have to worry about the dither introducing massive differences between frames if only one pixel changes in the source.</p>\n<p>While all three of those modes look viable in their own way, for Domination I had to make the decision to discard the middle one (320&#215;200, 4 colors). This is because the 16-color and 2-color modes display properly via the composite output jack on the CGA card, and I knew I&#8217;d have to present at the compo with the native hardware hooked up to a projector. \u00a0So my choices were limited to 160x200x16 and 640x200x2.</p>\n<h1>Managing Ch-Ch-Changes</h1>\n<p>The very fastest way to change screen memory on the 8088 is to either copy a linear sequence of bytes using REP MOVSB, or set a linear sequence of bytes all to the same value using REP STOSB. With this in mind, I chose to keep track of each change as a starting and ending offset of changed bytes, because that was closest to the exact method I would be using to &#8220;replay&#8221; those changes. I adopted a terminology to reduce\u00a0confusion throughout the source code: I coined the term &#8220;delta&#8221; to refer to an area of changed bytes, and further classified deltas into &#8220;slices&#8221; (a delta where not all bytes are the same) and &#8220;runs&#8221; (deltas where all bytes <em>are</em> the same). This was important because &#8220;runs&#8221; can fill screen memory extremely quickly using REP STOSB, so it was worth keeping track of them. Here is the actual data structure I used:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\">\r\n  TDelta=object(TObject)\r\n    startOfs:word;         {starting offset of delta in buffer (first changed byte)}\r\n    endOfs:word;           {ending offset of delta in buffer (last changed byte)}\r\n                           {rest are calculated during insert or other operations:}\r\n    dtype:deltaType;       {slice or run}\r\n    fillvalue:byte;        {for informational purposes only, not used for anything}\r\n    blength:word;          {length of delta in bytes}\r\n    numPixelsChanged:word; {# of pixels changed in the entire delta}\r\n    REPcycleCost:real;     {different whether slice or run}\r\n    frozen:boolean;        {flag used to control various optimization phases}\r\n\r\n    Constructor Init(starto,endo:word);\r\n    Destructor Done; virtual;\r\n  end;\r\n</pre>\n<p>All of these deltas needed a good structure to collect and manage them, so I decided to use a Turbo Pascal 7 data structure called a <a href=\"http://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/rtl/objects/tsortedcollection.html\">TSortedCollection</a>, which is analogous to a sorted linked list. Deltas were added to this list and maintained in sorted order using a variety of criteria in the following priority:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Larger/Longer Deltas placed before smaller/shorter ones</li>\n<li>Given the same length, &#8220;runs&#8221; placed before &#8220;slices&#8221;</li>\n<li>All runs sorted by their fill value</li>\n<li>Given the same length, all deltas sorted by their interlaced start offset in memory</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The sort order seems like an odd thing to mention here, doesn&#8217;t it? I&#8217;ve done so because it was a contributing factor to the success of the project, as it solved many data processing problems later on. It was so helpful\u00a0that I think it&#8217;s worth going over in detail:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Larger/Longer Deltas placed before smaller/shorter ones</span>: As we process deltas\u00a0from the top of the list to the bottom, the largest areas of the screen will change first until we run out of bandwidth. If we decide to completely jettison the list entirely before it is finished due to bandwidth starvation, only the smallest changes at the bottom of the list &#8212; the ones that don&#8217;t matter very much visually, as they only change a few pixels &#8212; are discarded.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Given the same length, &#8220;runs&#8221; placed before &#8220;slices&#8221;</span>: This gave priority to runs, because setting an area of screen memory with REP STOSB is both faster and smaller than trying to copy the same area with REP MOVSB.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">All runs sorted by their fill value</span>: This came in handy during the encoding phase, where I was able to set a fill value once and then cache that value for subsequent runs if applicable. I would not have been able to do that if all the similar fill values weren&#8217;t right next to each other.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Given the same length, all deltas sorted by their interlaced start offset in memory</span>: This was an aesthetic choice; if I had to change an area where all deltas were exactly the same length (like a rectangular area of the screen), this allowed the changes to &#8220;paint&#8221; in somewhat linear top-to-bottom order. \u00a0This is necessary because CGA&#8217;s framebuffer is not organized in a linear fashion, but is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_Graphics_Adapter#Limitations\">interlaced</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For the curious, this is what the sort operator looked like:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\">\r\nFunction TDeltas.Compare;\r\n{\r\nWe want to maximize motion fidelity, so we are going to make our lives\r\neasier and sort deltas by size.\r\nNote that the comparisons are reversed -- that's because we want the largest\r\ndeltas at the beginning of the list.  (-1 means beginning of collection.)\r\n- We add a second comparison so that deltas of the same length are sorted\r\nby cycle execution time; this keeps runs prioritized over slices in terms\r\nof what to prioritize if our bandwidth gets starved.\r\n- We add a third comparison so that runs of the same run value\r\nare kept together, so that we can cache the run value.\r\n- We can optionally add a fourth comparison so that, all things being equal,\r\ndeltas are sorted by start offset compensated for CGA interlaced memory layout\r\n(this is what I'm colloquially calling &quot;Dave Murry interlace handling&quot;\r\nbased on how Dave handled it in the PC booter Sierra Championship Boxing).\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar\r\n  k1so,k2so:word;\r\n\r\nbegin\r\n  k1so:=PDelta(Key1)^.startofs;\r\n  k2so:=PDelta(Key2)^.startofs;\r\n  if MurryHandling then begin\r\n    {if k1so &amp;gt; screenRAMsize div 2 then k1so:=k1so-(screenRAMsize div 2);\r\n    if k2so &amp;gt; screenRAMsize div 2 then k2so:=k2so-(screenRAMsize div 2);}\r\n    k1so:=k1so AND $1fff;\r\n    k2so:=k2so AND $1fff;\r\n  end;\r\n  {sort by delta length}\r\n  if PDelta(Key1)^.blength &amp;gt; PDelta(Key2)^.blength\r\n    then Compare := -1\r\n    else if PDelta(Key1)^.blength &amp;lt; PDelta(Key2)^.blength\r\n      then Compare := 1\r\n      {sort runs at a higher priority than slices}\r\n      else if PDelta(Key1)^.REPcycleCost  PDelta(Key2)^.REPcycleCost\r\n          then Compare := 1\r\n          {sort runs by fill value}\r\n          else if PDelta(Key1)^.fillvalue &amp;gt; PDelta(Key2)^.fillvalue\r\n            then Compare := -1\r\n            else if PDelta(Key1)^.fillvalue &amp;lt; PDelta(Key2)^.fillvalue\r\n              then Compare := 1\r\n              {sort deltas by start offset}\r\n              else if k1so  k2so\r\n                  then Compare := 1\r\n                  else Compare := 0;\r\nend;\r\n</pre>\n<p>With the data structures finalized, encoding one video frame&#8217;s worth of changes becomes a simple matter of doing the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Scan the preexisting frame and new source image for differences, and insert each found difference into the delta list data structure</li>\n<li>Determine the amount of CPU time and disk bandwidth we have available to paint our changes (a &#8220;byte pool&#8221; and a &#8220;cycle pool&#8221;)</li>\n<li>For every delta in the list, starting with the first and iterating to the last:\n<ol>\n<li>Estimate the cycle and byte cost to paint this delta</li>\n<li>If our cycle or byte pools won&#8217;t be exhausted by these costs, encode the delta to disk and then remove it from the list, then updated the pools</li>\n<li>If one of the pools <strong>will</strong> be exhausted, skip this delta and move to the next one, which will likely be smaller or faster (or both) and have a better chance of not exhausting a pool</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>If we empty the list, we&#8217;re done with the frame</li>\n<li>If we reach the end of the list, we are out of &#8220;time&#8221; for this frame and need to either:\n<ol>\n<li>Spend the next frame going through the list again to finish up so that the existing source image has a chance to fully display, or:</li>\n<li>Throw away whatever is left and start working on a new source image</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That&#8217;s pretty much it. When I release the source in a few weeks, you&#8217;ll see that the code implements the above logic very closely. However, there&#8217;s one very important detail that I haven&#8217;t explained yet, and it&#8217;s critical to playback performance: What does &#8220;encode the delta to disk&#8221; mean exactly, and how do we play an encoded delta back to screen memory as quickly as possible?
